<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Relayer Execution">
    Set `useRelayer: true` to have the IVC executes the transaction on your behalf.
    
    ```json Response
    {
      "success": true,
      "data": {
        "executed": true,
        "transactionHash": "0x...",
        "blockNumber": 12345678,
        "gasUsed": "150000"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Frontend Signing">
    Set `useRelayer: false` to receive transaction data for wallet signing.
    
    ```json Response
    {
      "success": true,
      "data": {
        "executed": false,
        "to": "0x...",
        "data": "0x...",
        "gasLimit": "200000",
        "description": "Create Light Token: MyToken (MTK)"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Default Partition

When no partition is specified, tokens use the default partition:
```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require a v2 API key with the `tokenization` service enabled:

```bash
x-api-key: trusset_v2_{instance_ref}_{secret}
```
