title: "Tokenization Framework"
description: "Security token infrastructure for real-world assets"
---

Our tokenization frameworks are a unique set of smart contracts tailored to specific functionalities and use cases, divided into 2 general groups:

## Token Models

### Light Tokens
Streamlined ERC20-based security tokens for representing existing real-world assets with established legal frameworks. These tokens focus on ownership representation with integrated compliance features while maintaining simplicity.

**Optimal for:**
- Existing equity shares with established shareholder agreements
- Bonds with existing indentures  
- Commodities with external storage and verification systems
- Any asset where detailed information exists off-chain

### Fat Tokens
Asset-specific implementations that bring complete asset management on-chain. Each asset type has its own contract set with specialized functionality, variables, and compliance mechanisms tailored to that asset class.

**Optimal for:**
- Creating new financial products entirely on-chain
- Automating complex asset management workflows
- Assets requiring specialized data structures and operations
- Native DeFi integration and composability

## Contract Infrastructure

### Core Components

| Contract | Address | Function |
|----------|---------|----------|
| TokenFactory | `0x71dAc2b700DaAAFfe47952323fa8F5E5B7c90baD` | Central deployment for new tokens |
| ValueRegister | `0x9e53Ed9F61122C3a7601Bb6834cDeBa435045423` | On-chain valuation data |
| SupplyMonitor | `0xB5f8E0e5f0861dC5Ebe077AD61D7066917F7554d` | Supply change tracking |
| RegisterAdapter | `0x04aFbf3CA3DEFB968De8376B0dBd2a8426AB24B4` | 3rd party register integration |
| ValueOracle | `0x956a4B9bEA43dED95EB327caa519d7eAe7ca5Dd3` | Synchronization and data updates |

### Deployment Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Token Creation">
    Deploy through TokenFactory with specified parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Set compliance features, fees, and metadata
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initial Distribution">
    Mint initial supply to designated addresses
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Configure supporting infrastructure (oracles, adapters)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Compliance Framework

### Transfer Controls
- **KYC Integration**: Automatic identity verification checks
- **Account Freezing**: Individual address suspension
- **Force Transfer**: Court-ordered or regulatory movements
- **Whitelist**: Approved address restrictions

### Fee Mechanisms
```
Total Fee
├── Platform Share (25%) → Platform Wallet
└── Issuer Share (75%) → Fee Recipient
```

## Security Architecture

### Access Control
**Multi-tier authorization system:**
- **Issuer**: Full control over token settings
- **Authority**: Mint, freeze, force transfer capabilities  
- **Factory**: Initial configuration permissions
- **Token Holders**: Standard transfer operations

### Decentralization
- No central admin keys
- Issuers maintain control of their tokens only
- User sovereignty over assets
- Transparent operation history

## Integration Options

### Direct Contract Interaction
```javascript
const params = {
    name: "Asset Token",
    symbol: "AST", 
    assetType: "EQUITY",
    kycRequired: true
};
const tx = await factory.createTokenFor(params, issuerAddress);
```

### API Integration
Full REST API support through our issuer platform for institutional-grade operations

### Oracle Integration
Automated value updates through configured oracle endpoints
