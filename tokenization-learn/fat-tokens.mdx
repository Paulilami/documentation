title: "Fat Tokens"
description: "Asset-specific smart contracts with comprehensive on-chain management"
---

Fat Tokens represent the next evolution in asset tokenization - bringing complete asset management and business logic on-chain. Unlike Light Tokens that reference external data, Fat Tokens encode all asset-specific information and operations directly into specialized smart contract implementations.

Each Fat Token deployment is a custom contract suite designed for its specific asset class, with tailored variables, functions, and compliance mechanisms that match the asset's real-world behavior and regulatory requirements.

<Info>
Fat Token implementations are currently available for our issuers and partners. Contact our team for early access and custom development opportunities for your specific asset class.
