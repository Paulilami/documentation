---

The Tokenization Studio provides a web-based interface for deploying security tokens directly from your browser. Create, configure, and manage tokens without writing code.

## Requirements

### Wallet Setup
Connect using one of the supported wallets:
- **MetaMask** (recommended)
- **Trust Wallet**
- **WalletConnect compatible wallets**

### Network Configuration
Currently deployed on Sepolia testnet for testing and validation.

**Network Details:**
- Network Name: Sepolia Testnet
- Chain ID: 11155111
- RPC URL: `https://rpc.sepolia.org`
- Block Explorer: `https://sepolia.etherscan.io`

### Test ETH
Obtain Sepolia ETH for gas fees from faucets:
- [Google Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) (recommended)
- [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com)
- [Infura Sepolia Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia)

## Token Creation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    Click "Connect Wallet" and select your wallet provider
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Token">
    Set name, symbol, and initial supply parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Features">
    Choose compliance features and operational flags
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Fees">
    Configure optional mint, transfer, and burn fees
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Metadata">
    Include tags and document URIs for reference
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Review configuration and deploy to blockchain
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Options

### Basic Parameters
- **Token Name**: Full name of the asset
- **Symbol**: 3-5 character ticker symbol
- **Decimals**: Divisibility (default 18)
- **Asset Type**: Classification (EQUITY, BOND, REAL_ESTATE, etc.)

### Compliance Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| KYC Required | Enforce identity verification |
| Whitelist Only | Restrict to approved addresses |
| Pausable | Enable emergency pause |
| Force Transfer | Allow authority movements |
| Recovery | Recover from lost wallets |

### Fee Configuration
Set optional fees in ETH:
- **Mint Fee**: Cost to create new tokens
- **Transfer Fee**: Cost per transfer
- **Burn Fee**: Cost to destroy tokens

### Initial Distribution (soon)
Optionally mint initial supply to specified addresses during deployment:
```
Recipient Address | Amount
0x123...         | 1,000,000
0x456...         | 500,000
```

## Post-Deployment Management

After deployment, the studio provides:

### Token Dashboard
- Contract address and transaction hash
- Current supply and holder count
- Active features and fee structure
- Recent transactions

### Management Functions
- Mint additional tokens
- Freeze/unfreeze accounts
- Update metadata and documents
- Modify fee structure

### Integration Tools
- Copy contract address for API integration
- Export ABI for direct interaction
- Generate API credentials for programmatic access

## Testing Workflow

<Tip>
Test your token configuration on Sepolia before mainnet deployment:
1. Create token with desired features
2. Execute test transactions
3. Verify compliance controls
4. Test API integration
5. Request mainnet deployment
</Tip>

## Common Issues

### Transaction Failures
- Insufficient Sepolia ETH for gas
- Wallet not connected to Sepolia network
- Invalid recipient addresses

### Feature Conflicts
- Force transfer requires explicit enabling
- KYC and whitelist are independent systems
- Unlimited supply disables supply cap validation

## Migration to Mainnet

Once testing is complete, contact our team for mainnet deployment:
1. Export configuration from Sepolia deployment
2. Submit mainnet deployment request
3. Review gas estimates and fees
4. Execute deployment with mainnet ETH
5. Receive production contract addresses

## Studio Access

Access the Tokenization Studio now at: [https://studio.trusset.org](https://studio.trusset.org)

<Note>
The studio interface automatically handles gas estimation, nonce management, and transaction confirmation. All deployments are permanent and immutable once confirmed on-chain.
