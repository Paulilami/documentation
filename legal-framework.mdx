## Our Position

Trusset provides technology infrastructure—not custody, not asset management, not control.

Banks and financial institutions deploy their own on-chain capital markets using our stack. You maintain full control and regulatory responsibility. We handle the blockchain complexity.

## Why This Works Legally

### You Own Your Contracts

Every client receives completely isolated smart contract environments. These contracts are yours—deployed through our factory, but controlled by your administrator keys.

Trusset has **no access** to your contracts. No authority roles. No ability to alter, pause, or intervene.

You nominate your administrators. You define the rules. You operate independently.

### Distributed Governance Through DAO

Our network operates through a multi-signature DAO where verified institutions become equal governance partners. When you join, you receive a proportional key share alongside other institutions.

With ten issuers, each holds one-tenth of network control. This structure prevents any single party—including Trusset—from making unilateral decisions.

No vendor lock-in. No single point of control. Just distributed governance among equals.

### Automated, Transparent Fees

Trusset receives 25% of transaction fees, distributed automatically through smart contracts. This happens on-chain without manual intervention.

We never touch client funds. The remaining 75% flows directly to your institution. The fee split occurs at protocol level—transparent, immutable, and automatic.

### You Control Compliance

All compliance decisions originate from your systems. Your backend manages KYC verification, investment approvals, and regulatory controls.

Our infrastructure executes the triggers you define. Every action traces to its originator, creating complete audit trails for regulators.

**Trusset never initiates transactions independently.** We provide the rails; you drive the train.

### Security Standards

Our framework meets EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) requirements:

- Independent smart contract audits before deployment
- Regular penetration testing and version-controlled updates
- Multi-layer key management with redundant backups
- Zero-knowledge proofs for KYC data—encrypted and never stored in Trusset systems

Your sensitive data remains in your control. Cryptographic verification enables compliance without exposure.

## What This Means Operationally

**Legal Certainty:** Trusset cannot access your contracts, funds, or make decisions on your behalf. Multi-signature governance ensures long-term stability without vendor dependencies.

**Regulatory Compliance:** Your existing frameworks integrate seamlessly. You maintain all regulatory responsibilities and controls—we're infrastructure, like cloud services or payment networks.

**Operational Independence:** Deploy your tokenization strategy without dependencies. Your isolated environment means other clients' actions cannot affect your operations.

## Summary

You operate as the regulated entity with complete control. Trusset provides the technology layer that lets you replicate your existing capital markets on-chain—with the same services, same controls, same compliance.

The blockchain complexity is ours. The client relationships and regulatory responsibilities are yours.

That's the division of labor that makes institutional blockchain adoption actually work.
