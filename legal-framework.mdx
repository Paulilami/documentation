## Our Position

Trusset provides the technology layer for tokenization. We are not an issuer, custodian, or asset register. Banks and financial institutions use our infrastructure while maintaining full control and regulatory responsibility for their operations.

## Five Pillars of Legal Certainty

### 1. Multi-Signature Governance

Our network operates through a distributed control model that prevents any single party from having unilateral access. The system uses a multi-signature DAO structure where verified issuers become partners in the network, each holding an equal share of governance rights.

When you join the network, you receive a proportional key share alongside other verified institutions. With ten issuers, each holds one-tenth of the network control. This distributed model ensures no single entity, including Trusset, can make unilateral decisions or access client systems.

### 2. Isolated Contract Architecture

Every client receives their own dedicated smart contract environment, completely isolated from other clients. These contracts are deployed through factory contracts with a single API call, using pre-defined and auditable rulesets.

You nominate your own administrator key and maintain exclusive control over your contracts. Trusset has no access to these contracts and holds no authority roles within them. This isolation ensures complete operational independence while benefiting from shared infrastructure.

### 3. Automated Fee Distribution

Our business model is transparent and automated. Trusset receives a 25% maintenance fee from transaction fees, distributed automatically through smart contracts. This happens on-chain without any manual intervention.

We never touch client or investor funds. The fee splitting occurs at the protocol level, maintaining our position as a neutral technology provider. The remaining 75% of fees flow directly to your institution, creating aligned incentives without custody risks.

### 4. Client-Controlled Compliance

All compliance decisions and transaction approvals originate from your systems, not ours. Your backend manages KYC verification, investment approvals, and regulatory controls. Our infrastructure simply executes the secure triggers you define.

Every action is traceable to its originator, creating a complete audit trail for regulators. Trusset never initiates transactions independently. We provide the rails; you drive the train. This separation ensures you maintain full regulatory control while leveraging automated infrastructure.

### 5. DORA-Compliant Security

Our security framework meets the stringent requirements of the EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act. All smart contracts undergo independent audits before deployment, with regular penetration testing and version-controlled updates.

Key management follows multi-layer security protocols with redundant backups. Personal data, particularly KYC information, is encrypted using zero-knowledge proofs and never stored in Trusset systems. Your sensitive data remains in your control, with cryptographic verification enabling compliance without exposure.

## What This Means for You

### Legal Certainty
You operate with confidence knowing Trusset cannot access your contracts, funds, or make decisions on your behalf. The multi-signature governance ensures long-term stability without vendor lock-in.

### Regulatory Compliance
Your existing compliance frameworks integrate seamlessly. You maintain all regulatory responsibilities and controls, using our technology as infrastructure similar to cloud services or payment networks.

### Operational Independence
Deploy your tokenization strategy without dependencies. Your isolated environment means other clients' actions cannot affect your operations, and you can configure rules to match your specific requirements.

## Summary

Trusset provides the technology infrastructure for tokenization while you retain complete control as the regulated entity. Our framework ensures you can offer tokenized securities with legal certainty, operational resilience, and full regulatory compliance. We handle the technology complexity; you maintain the client relationships and regulatory responsibilities.
