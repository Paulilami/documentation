Stock tokenization under the **eWpG framework** requires a licensed legal structure before minting tokens on mainnet. To start building and testing immediately, create a [development instance](/new/home/infrastructure/instances), it runs on testnet by default. Once your legal framework is in place (prospectus, internal approval, etc.), convert it to a production instance on mainnet. Stock tokens use the official [ERC3643 token standard](https://www.erc3643.org/).

<Note>
You will need sepolia ethereum to create your tokens. Get free tokens [here](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) 
</Note>

<Warning>
All issued stock tokens automatically integrate our [identity register](/new/learn/customers/identity-register) / [customer management system](/new/learn/customers/customer-management) to ensure contract-sided compliance. Please ensure to verify recipients before sending tokens to avoid errors.
</Warning>
