<Note>
Our stock lending markets use the underlying order book as a pre-configured liquidation route. You can integrate your own trading venue for liquidation after setup.
</Note>

## 1. Open the Lending Page

Navigate to <Badge color="gray" size="sm">Lend</Badge> in the sidebar and choose <Badge color="gray" size="sm">Stocks</Badge>, then click <Badge color="gray" size="sm">Add Market</Badge> to create a new lending market.
