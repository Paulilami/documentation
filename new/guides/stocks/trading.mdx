For tokenized stocks, Trusset only uses the **[Hybrid Order Book](/new/home/integration/modules/orderbook-module)** system. 

<Note>
Order books use unified liquidity per **underlying** stock. This comes from our sub-issuer (register participant) model where we only use one token address per underlying stock while each sub-issuer operates in their isolated environment.
