Gold tokenization under the **MiCA Asset-Referenced Token (Art. 8) framework** requires a licensed legal structure before minting tokens on mainnet. To start building and testing immediately, create a [development instance](/new/home/infrastructure/instances), it runs on testnet by default. Once your legal framework is in place, convert it to a production instance on mainnet.
