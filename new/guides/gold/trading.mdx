Trusset offers two trading solutions for tokenized commodities:

1. **[Hybrid Order Book](/new/home/integration/modules/orderbook-module)**: Off-chain matching with on-chain custody. Connect the hybrid order book to our off-chain [balance tracking system](/endpoints/v2/custody/overview) for gasless transactions at zero overhead.
2. **[Automated Market Maker (AMM)](/new/learn/trading/amm/balancer-pools)**: Balancer-based trading pools customized for tokenized assets, suited for large markets and full decentralization.

Both solutions require the contract admin to hold a [CASP license](https://www.afm.nl/en/sector/cryptopartijen/vereisten-en-vergunningen/casp-vergunning) to legally operate the trading services. The admin role can be assigned to any wallet. Compliance rules are inherited directly from the token contract, see [commodity token documentation](/new/learn/tokenization/categories/commodities) for details.

<Note>
Browse all MiCA licensed entities in the [MiCA register](https://www.trusset.org/mica-register), synchronized hourly with official EU registers.
