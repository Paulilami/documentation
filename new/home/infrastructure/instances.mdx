description: "Isolated environments for accessing Trusset services independently"
---

Instances are isolated environments that control access to Trusset APIs on your chosen blockchain network. Each instance operates independently with dedicated API keys, data storage, and smart contract deployments.

<Note>
Instances are completely free to create—no setup fees or monthly charges.
</Note>

## Adaptive Services

Instances automatically adapt to your institution's regulatory licenses, enabling only the services you're authorized to operate:

    <Card title="Asset Tokenization" icon="coins">
        Issue security tokens, commodities, real estate, and other tokenized assets
    </Card>
    <Card title="Identity Verification" icon="id-card">
        KYC/AML compliance with privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs
    </Card>
    <Card title="Trading Services" icon="chart-line">
        AMM pools and listing-based marketplaces for tokenized assets
    </Card>
    <Card title="Lending Services" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
        Overcollateralized lending markets against tokenized collateral
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

The Issuer Platform displays only enabled services based on your verified licenses—preventing access to unauthorized functionality.

## Instance Types

Separate development and production environments for safe testing before mainnet deployment:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Development Instances">
        Automatically deploy to test networks for risk-free experimentation:

        - Free testnet tokens for gas fees
        - Identical functionality to production
        - Isolated from mainnet operations
        - Reset anytime without consequences
        - Perfect for integration testing

        Test thoroughly in development before moving to production—bugs in production cost real money.
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Production Instances">
        Deploy to mainnets for live operations with real assets:

        - Requires real tokens for gas fees
        - Immutable smart contract deployments
        - Irreversible transactions
        - Subject to network fees
        - Monitored for security incidents

        Convert development instances to production seamlessly—pays only gas fees for contract migrations.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Target Network

Choose your blockchain network during instance creation—this decision is permanent. The instance adapts all services to the chosen network automatically.

<Accordion title="Network Selection Considerations">
Select networks based on your requirements:

**Ethereum:** Maximum security and liquidity, higher transaction costs, largest DeFi ecosystem.

**Base:** Lower costs than Ethereum, Coinbase backing, growing adoption, emerging ecosystem.

**Arbitrum:** Ethereum security with reduced costs, established DeFi presence, fast finality.

**Solana:** Extremely fast and cheap transactions, different programming model, growing institutional adoption.

**Avalanche:** Subnet customization, institutional focus, bridge to Ethereum ecosystem.

We'll soon launch cross-instance bridges enabling asset migration between networks without redeployment.
</Accordion>

## Instance Limits

| Property | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Total Instances | 5 × verified_services* |
| API Calls (Testnet) | Unlimited |
| API Calls (Mainnet) | Usage-based pricing (coming soon) |
| API Keys per Instance | 3 maximum |
| Data Storage | 100GB per instance (expandable) |

*verified_services = number of licensed service categories you hold (tokenization, trading, lending, etc.)

## API Key Management

Each instance supports up to three API keys with independent permissions and rate limits. Visit [API Key Management](/api-key-management) for detailed configuration instructions.

## Service Isolation

Data never leaks between instances—complete isolation at every level:

- **Database Isolation:** Each instance stores data in separate encrypted databases inaccessible to other instances.

- **Smart Contract Isolation:** Instance-specific contracts deploy independently—no shared state or cross-instance calls.

- **API Isolation:** API keys only access their instance's resources—cannot query other instances even accidentally.

- **Network Isolation:** Instances on different blockchains operate completely independently.

## Monitoring & Webhooks

Configure webhooks receiving real-time notifications about instance activity:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Token Events
// Webhook receives token mints, burns, transfers
{
  "event": "token.minted",
  "instanceId": "inst_abc123",
  "tokenAddress": "0x...",
  "recipient": "0x...",
  "amount": "1000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T12:34:56Z"
}
```

```typescript Trading Events
// Webhook receives swap executions, liquidations
{
  "event": "swap.executed",
  "instanceId": "inst_abc123",
  "poolId": "0x...",
  "trader": "0x...",
  "amountIn": "1000000000",
  "amountOut": "995000000",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T12:34:56Z"
}
```

```typescript Lending Events
// Webhook receives borrows, repayments, liquidations
{
  "event": "position.liquidated",
  "instanceId": "inst_abc123",
  "positionId": 42,
  "liquidator": "0x...",
  "debtRepaid": "8000000000",
  "collateralSeized": "42000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T12:34:56Z"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Instance Migration

Convert development instances to production after testing completes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Configuration">
    Ensure all settings, smart contracts, and integrations work correctly in development environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initiate Migration">
    Request migration through Issuer Platform—specify target mainnet and confirm irreversibility.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contract Deployment">
    System deploys all smart contracts to mainnet with identical configuration—pay gas fees for deployments (one-time fee).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Integrations">
    Modify backend API calls to use mainnet instance ID (ID stays the same when converting from dev. to prod. instance and optionally can be roted).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Begin Operations">
    Instance now operates on mainnet—all actions use real assets and incur real costs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Instance migration is irreversible. Test exhaustively in development before migrating to production—bugs in production lose real money.
</Warning>
