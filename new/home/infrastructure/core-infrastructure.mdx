Our infrastructure combines isolated off-chain environments with dedicated smart contracts that only you control. We synchronize your existing data with on-chain markets through automated relayers, enabling you to replicate existing services more efficiently without rewriting your codebase.

## Architecture Overview

## The Issuer Platform

Access to the [Issuer Platform](https://issuers.trusset.org/) is required to use Trusset services. This central dashboard provides 24/7 monitoring, manual operations, and API key management for all your on-chain markets.

The platform adapts automatically to your instance configuration, displaying only relevant features based on your regulatory licenses and enabled services.

## Integration Methods

Access Trusset services through three integration paths:

- **Issuer Platform:** Manual operations through web interface—simplest option for getting started and monitoring operations.

- **APIs:** Programmatic access using API keys—enables full automation integrating with existing backend systems.

- **White Label Platforms:** Deploy branded web applications for your end users—provides complete user-facing interface under your domain.

Most institutions combine all three: APIs for automation, Issuer Platform for monitoring, and White Label for customer access.
