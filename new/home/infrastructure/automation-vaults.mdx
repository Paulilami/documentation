Automation Vaults transform API calls into blockchain transactions automatically. No wallet extensions, no manual signing—just REST API calls that execute on-chain operations seamlessly.

## How It Works

Vaults are ERC-4337 smart accounts that hold funds and execute operations on your behalf. When your backend calls an API endpoint, the vault signs and submits the blockchain transaction automatically.

## Funding & Operations

Vaults require ETH (or native network tokens) to pay transaction fees. You fund vaults once, and they execute operations until funds deplete. The platform alerts you when balances run low.

Configure which operations each vault can perform—minting tokens, updating prices, processing redemptions, or managing compliance. Vaults only execute enabled functions, preventing unauthorized actions.

## Management

Control vaults entirely through the Issuer Platform or API:

- **Pause/Resume:** Stop vault operations immediately during emergencies or maintenance without losing configuration.

- **Fund Management:** Deposit additional ETH when needed or withdraw excess funds to external wallets.

- **Monitoring:** Set up alerts triggering when vault balances fall below thresholds or transaction failures occur.

- **Operation Logs:** View complete history of all vault transactions with gas costs and execution status.

**Deletion:** Remove vaults permanently after withdrawing remaining funds—irreversible action requiring confirmation.

## Security Model

Automation Vaults follow the ERC-4337 standard with additional security layers:

- **Rate Limiting:** Configure maximum operations per day for each enabled function, preventing abuse if API keys compromise.

- **Function Restrictions:** Vaults only execute pre-approved operations—cannot perform arbitrary transactions.

- **Instance Isolation:** Each instance's vaults operate independently—compromise of one vault doesn't affect others.

<Note>
Automation Vaults are smart contracts deployed on-chain. Fund them adequately for uninterrupted service, but don't over-fund—withdraw excess balances to cold storage.
</Note>

## Contract Architecture

Automation Vaults use Instance Vault Contracts (IVCs) that integrate seamlessly with all Trusset smart contracts. IVCs hold elevated permissions for administrative functions while enforcing rate limits and function restrictions.

The IVC contract set undergoes governance through the [Trusset Upgrade DAO](/new/learn/governance/contract-updates), ensuring changes receive community review before deployment.
