## Test Everything

The Trusset Testing Suite is a complete sandbox environment where you validate your tokenization infrastructure before production deployment. Test all services end-to-end on testnet networks with full functionality—no real assets, no blockchain costs, no risk.

## What You Can Test

## Testing Perspectives

Test from multiple viewpoints to validate complete workflows. Experience your platform as customers will—investing, trading, borrowing, transferring assets. Switch to the administrator view to test compliance actions, parameter updates, corporate actions, and emergency controls. Use the operator dashboard to monitor activities, configure webhooks, and validate reporting systems.

## Integration Testing

The suite supports custom data integrations without touching your production systems. Map fields from your existing customer database, test synchronization with your KYC provider, validate price feed connections, and configure webhook endpoints for real-time notifications. All testing happens on testnet with mock data.

## What Gets Tested

Test tokenization workflows including token issuance with compliance rules, KYC verification and transfer restrictions, corporate actions and profit distributions, and redemption mechanisms. Validate your trading infrastructure by testing marketplace deployment, order matching and settlement, price discovery, and liquidity pool operations.

The lending system tests cover collateral deposit and valuation, loan origination and disbursement, interest accrual and payment, and liquidation triggers. Compliance controls verify account freezing, transfer restriction enforcement, investor eligibility, and regulatory reporting outputs.

Backend integration testing validates data synchronization accuracy, webhook delivery and retry logic, error handling and recovery, and performance under load.

## Move to Production

Once testing validates your implementation, switch from testnet to mainnet with one configuration update. Your tested contracts deploy to the production environment and you start processing real transactions with proven workflows. No code changes required between testing and production—same APIs, same logic, same infrastructure.

<Info>
The testing environment operates entirely on testnet networks. No real funds, no blockchain costs, no risk to production systems.
