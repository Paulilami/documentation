The Management Module is your control center for token operations. Execute minting, burning, transfers, and compliance actions through visual workflows without writing code. The module includes batch operations for efficiency and analytics dashboards for oversight.

## What You Can Do

Mint tokens to single addresses or distribute to thousands through CSV import. Execute transfers with automatic compliance checks and manage shareholder lists directly in the interface. Burn tokens for redemptions or supply adjustments with built-in audit trails.

Handle compliance operations including account freezing and unfreezing, transfer restriction updates, and regulatory reporting. All actions enforce your token's compliance rules automatically—no manual verification required.

## Batch Operations

Process multiple operations simultaneously to save time. Import shareholder lists via CSV and mint to hundreds of addresses in one transaction. Execute mass transfers for profit distributions or corporate actions. Update compliance settings for multiple accounts at once.

## Analytics & Reporting

Track token distribution across holder addresses and monitor transaction volumes over time. View holder demographics and wallet activity patterns. Export reports directly or configure automated reporting schedules for compliance and investor relations.

The dashboard provides real-time insights into your token ecosystem—total supply, holder count, transfer velocity, and compliance status all visible at a glance.

## Access Control

The module adapts automatically based on connected wallet permissions. Token issuers see full management capabilities including minting and burning. Compliance officers access freezing and restriction controls. Standard administrators view reports and execute approved transfers. The blockchain determines who sees what—no manual permission configuration.
