The Borrow Module transforms idle tokens into active liquidity through overcollateralized lending. Deposit any tokenized asset as collateral and borrow stablecoins or other supported currencies instantly. The unified loan engine adapts automatically to Light Tokens, Fat Tokens, Stock Tokens, and standard ERC20s.

## How It Works

Deposit tokens to your collateral vault and borrow up to your approved loan-to-value ratio. The system values your collateral through integrated price oracles and calculates your borrowing capacity in real-time. Interest accrues automatically and can be paid at any time. Repay the loan to unlock your collateral—no fixed terms or payment schedules.

Smart contracts manage everything automatically. No credit checks, no approval delays, no manual risk assessment. Your collateral determines borrowing capacity and the blockchain enforces all terms.

## Dynamic Risk Management

Loan-to-value ratios adjust based on asset risk profiles. Volatile assets receive lower LTV ratios for safety. Stable assets or those with issuer guarantees qualify for higher borrowing capacity. The system monitors collateral value continuously and updates borrowing limits in real-time as prices change.

If collateral value drops and your loan approaches the liquidation threshold, the system sends automated warnings. Add more collateral or repay part of the loan to restore healthy LTV ratios. Ignore warnings and the system triggers automatic liquidation to protect lenders.

## Liquidation Process

Liquidation activates when your LTV ratio exceeds the configured threshold. The system first offers issuers the option to buy back their tokens at a discount to preserve holder relationships. If issuers decline or don't respond within the timeframe, the protocol liquidates collateral through the trading module to cover the outstanding loan.

Borrowers receive any remaining value after loan repayment and liquidation fees. The entire process runs automatically through smart contracts—no manual intervention required.

## Liquidity Configuration

Choose between instance-specific pools or global liquidity. Instance pools isolate risk—tokens from Instance A borrow only from liquidity provided to Instance A. Global pools maximize capital efficiency—enable one instance as the liquidity hub and all your tokens across instances can borrow from shared reserves.

Configure your liquidity strategy through the Issuer Platform interface. Switch between models without code changes as your needs evolve.

## Borrower Dashboard

View all collateral positions and outstanding loans in one interface. Monitor real-time LTV ratios with visual health indicators. Track interest accrual and total debt. Add collateral or make payments with one-click transactions. Set up alerts for LTV threshold warnings.

The dashboard shows borrowing capacity updates as collateral values change, helping you maximize capital efficiency while maintaining safe margin levels.
