The Investor Dashboard Module provides complete investor relationship management for token administrators. View and manage all token holders with granular access controls, communications tools, and automated compliance reporting. The module adapts interface elements based on connected wallet permissions.

## Access Levels

Standard users see their own holdings and basic portfolio metrics. Enhanced access unlocks detailed analytics, document libraries, and historical transaction data. Management access provides full investor data with bulk operations, export capabilities, and administrative tools.

The system determines access level automatically from the connected wallet address. No manual permission assignment required—the blockchain controls who sees what based on their role in your token ecosystem.

## Investor Communications

Send messages to individual holders or broadcast to groups filtered by token holdings, investment date, or compliance status. The module tracks message delivery and read status. Schedule communications in advance or trigger automated messages based on events like distributions, corporate actions, or compliance updates.

Maintain communication history with searchable archives. Export conversation logs for compliance documentation. Configure notification channels including email, in-app messages, or webhook integrations to external systems.

## Compliance Tracking

Monitor KYC status across all token holders with visual indicators for verification state. Track accreditation expiration dates and trigger renewal workflows automatically. Generate regulatory reports showing investor demographics, geographic distribution, and compliance metrics.

The dashboard flags holders requiring attention—expired credentials, pending verifications, or restricted transfer attempts. Export compliance data in formats required by regulators or auditors.

## Distribution Management

Execute profit distributions, dividend payments, or token airdrops to all holders or filtered groups. The module calculates amounts based on holdings automatically and handles batch transactions efficiently. Track distribution history with complete audit trails showing amounts, recipients, and execution timestamps.

Configure distribution rules including minimum holding periods, vesting schedules, or proportional allocation formulas. The system enforces all rules automatically during execution.

## Portfolio Analytics

View aggregated portfolio metrics across your entire token holder base. Track holder count growth over time, average holdings per address, and concentration ratios. Monitor trading velocity and holder turnover rates. Identify largest holders and analyze distribution patterns.

Export detailed reports for investor relations, board presentations, or strategic planning. Schedule automated report generation and delivery to stakeholders.

## Bulk Operations

Process multiple investor actions simultaneously through CSV import. Update contact information, compliance status, or custom attributes for hundreds of holders at once. Execute mass communications or distributions without individual transactions.

The module validates bulk operations before execution and provides detailed error reports if any records fail validation. Rollback capabilities protect against accidental changes.
