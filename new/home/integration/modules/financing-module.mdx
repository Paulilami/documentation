The Financing Module enables buyers to purchase tokens with structured financing while sellers earn interest as lenders. Complete mortgage infrastructure runs on smart contracts with automated payment collection, default management, and token release upon completion.

## How It Works

Buyers purchase tokens with down payments ranging from 25-80% of the token price. The remaining balance converts to a structured loan with algorithmically calculated interest rates based on down payment size and loan term. Smart contracts collect payments automatically and release tokens to the buyer once the mortgage completes.

Sellers become lenders and earn interest on financed purchases. The module handles all payment scheduling, interest calculation, and default management without manual intervention. Tokens remain locked in escrow until full payment or default resolution.

## Borrower Interface

Track payment schedules and outstanding balances in real-time. Make payments directly through the interface with automatic on-chain settlement. View interest accrual and projected completion dates. Manage multiple mortgage positions from one dashboard with consolidated reporting.

The system sends payment reminders and updates borrowers on mortgage status changes automatically through configured notification channels.

## Lender Interface

Monitor all financed sales with detailed loan performance data. Track returns including interest earned and payment history. Handle defaults through automated liquidation or manual resolution options. Export lending reports for tax and accounting purposes.

Lenders see real-time mortgage health indicators including payment status, collateral value, and days until completion or default threshold.

## Administrator Controls

Oversee all mortgages in your instance with complete visibility into borrower and lender activity. Manage default cases with discretionary authority over liquidation timing and terms. Generate compliance reports showing all financing activity and outstanding obligations.

Configure system parameters including minimum down payment percentages, maximum loan terms, interest rate formulas, and default thresholds through the Issuer Platform interface.

## Risk Management

Smart contracts enforce payment schedules automatically. Missed payments trigger default procedures based on your configured thresholds. The system can automatically liquidate collateral or offer lenders manual resolution options. All terms lock at mortgage creation—no mid-loan modifications without borrower consent.
