The Capital Raise Module enables token sales directly from your white-label platform. Configure sale parameters, accept investments in stablecoins, and manage investor allocations through a unified interface. The system handles soft caps, hard caps, vesting schedules, and refund logic automatically. You can find an example page [here](sale/0xb91bc9042f8b44735f115fdb5d9a64a03393ab7f).

## Creating a Sale

Launch a token sale from any token's management page. Set the price per token, define soft and hard caps, and configure minimum and maximum investment amounts per wallet. Choose your payment token—USDC, USDT, or DAI—and set start and end dates.

The system deploys a dedicated sale contract for each offering. Your tokens transfer to the contract automatically. Investors interact with this contract directly, and all funds remain on-chain until settlement conditions are met.

## Investment Flow

Investors connect their wallet and see available offerings on your platform. They enter an investment amount, approve the payment token, and execute the transaction. The contract validates whitelist status if enabled, checks investment limits, and records the allocation immediately.

No manual processing required. The blockchain handles validation, payment collection, and record-keeping in a single transaction.

## Soft Caps and Refunds

If a sale ends without reaching its soft cap, investors can claim full refunds directly from the contract. No administrative action needed—the refund function becomes available automatically when the sale ends below target.

Sales that meet or exceed soft cap proceed to settlement. Investors claim their tokens and the issuer withdraws collected funds. The system enforces these rules at the contract level.

## Vesting Schedules

Configure token release schedules during sale creation. Set multiple unlock dates with percentage allocations—for example, 25% at close, 25% after 3 months, 50% after 12 months. Investors claim available tokens as each vesting milestone passes.

The vesting logic lives in the sale contract. Investors see their total allocation, unlocked amount, and next unlock date in the interface. Claims execute instantly when tokens become available.

## Whitelist Management

Enable whitelisting to restrict participation to approved addresses. Add investors individually or import lists via CSV. Remove addresses at any time before they invest. The contract checks whitelist status on every investment attempt.

Use whitelisting for private rounds, geographic restrictions, or accredited investor requirements. Combine with your KYC module to automate approval workflows.

## Investor Tracking

View all investors in a sale with their investment amounts, token allocations, and claim status. Export investor lists for compliance reporting or integration with external systems. Track total raised, remaining capacity, and time until close from the sale dashboard.

The module maintains complete records on-chain. Every investment, claim, and refund creates an auditable transaction with timestamp and wallet address.

## Settlement Options

Configure what happens to unsold tokens when a sale ends. Return them to your wallet automatically, burn them to reduce supply, or leave them in the contract for future use. The settlement type is fixed at sale creation and executes automatically.

Withdraw collected funds after soft cap is reached. The issuer address receives full withdrawal rights. For compliance scenarios, the platform can redirect funds to alternate addresses if required.
