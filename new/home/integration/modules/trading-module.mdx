The Trading Module provides complete marketplace infrastructure for your tokens. The system automatically adapts to your token type—compliance-checked marketplace for securities or Balancer pool integration for ERC20s with continuous automated trading.

## Security Token Trading

ERC1400 security tokens and Capital Raise tokens trade through the compliance-checked marketplace. Token holders create fixed-price listings or auction formats with automatic KYC verification and transfer restriction enforcement. The module handles escrow, settlement, and regulatory compliance for every transaction.

Sellers control listing parameters including price, duration, and accepted payment methods. Buyers browse available listings and execute purchases with instant compliance verification. All trades enforce your token's transfer restrictions automatically—rejected transactions never reach the blockchain.

## ERC20 Token Trading

Stock tokens and standard ERC20s connect to Balancer liquidity pools for 24/7 automated trading. No order books or manual matching required—automated market makers provide continuous liquidity and price discovery around the clock.

Liquidity providers deposit tokens to earn trading fees. Traders swap instantly at algorithmically determined prices based on pool reserves. The system handles all pool mathematics, fee distribution, and settlement automatically.

## Market Analytics

Track trading volumes, price movements, and liquidity depth in real-time. View order history and settlement data with exportable reports for compliance. Monitor market maker performance and fee generation across all trading pairs.

The dashboard shows active listings, completed transactions, and current liquidity positions. Filter by token type, date range, or counterparty for detailed analysis.

## Automatic Integration

Tokens issued in your instance appear in the trading module automatically with proper market structure. Security tokens deploy with marketplace interface. ERC20 tokens connect to Balancer pools. No additional configuration required—the system recognizes token types and provisions appropriate trading infrastructure.
