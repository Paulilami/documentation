title: "Intro to Trusset"
---

Trusset is an open and free-to-use protocol for financial institutions that turns any asset into liquid collateral. We provide next-generation infrastructure APIs for tokenization, trading, and lending. This allows our customers to independently replicate their existing capital markets on the blockchain and synchronizing operations directly from their backend.

Our credit-first architecture makes liquidity the default. Any asset becomes active collateral instantly. Settlement runs automatically, on your terms. You deploy the market, remove the friction, and retain full control while generating new revenue.

Start with what matters to you: understand the infrastructure, explore integration paths, test the complete suite, or request access to build.
