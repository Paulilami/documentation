Cross-instance operations let you manage multiple instances from a single unified control point. Enable unified instance mode in your [automation vault (IVC)](/new/learn/automation/architecture) to consolidate monitoring, analytics, and transaction funding across all deployments while maintaining isolated token operations and compliance rules.

## Unified Instance Mode

Select one instance as your unified instance to centralize operational management. **All API calls route through this instance's IVC** for consolidated monitoring and usage tracking. View aggregated metrics across all tokens, instances, and operations from a single dashboard—transaction volumes, gas spending, user activity, and liquidity flows appear in one place without switching contexts.

## Consolidated Funding

When unified mode is enabled, deposit ETH only into the unified instance. This single balance pays for all transactions across every instance you control. Minting tokens in Instance A, executing trades in Instance B, and updating compliance in Instance C all draw from one unified balance.

Monitor aggregate spending with detailed breakdowns showing gas consumption per instance, per token, and per operation type. Set spending alerts and limits at the unified level preventing runaway costs across all instances.

## Instance Isolation

Unified mode affects only monitoring and funding—token operations remain fully isolated per instance. Each instance maintains separate compliance rules, identity registries, access controls, and token configurations. Transfers between instances require explicit bridge operations. A compliance issue in one instance doesn't affect others.

## Configuration

Enable unified instance mode through the issuer portal by selecting your primary instance as the unified hub and funding it with sufficient ETH for cross-instance operations. The system automatically configures routing for all existing instances. Disable anytime to resume per-instance monitoring and funding.

<Note>
Unified instance mode is optional. Instances operate independently by default with separate funding and monitoring. Enable unified mode only when centralized management provides operational benefits.
