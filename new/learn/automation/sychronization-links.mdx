Synchronization links connect your existing data systems directly to blockchain state. Update asset valuations, risk scores, and metadata on-chain through automated feeds or manual verification—no consensus mechanism required since financial institutions maintain data accuracy through regulatory compliance and reputational risk.

## Verification Methods

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Verification Requests" icon="list">
    Manually verify asset data when requested. Review and submit valuations, risk scores, and asset details on-demand through the issuer portal.

## Manual Verification Requests

Handle incoming requests to verify asset data through the issuer portal interface. View pending verification requests with full asset context, submit valuations and risk scores with supporting documentation, set validity periods determining verification expiration, and track complete verification history with timestamps and signatures.

Submit data points including asset name and physical location, current valuation in your preferred currency converted to ETH equivalent, risk scores for market volatility and credit exposure, and issuer details with reference documentation. Each verification receives a unique reference ID following the format RWA-[contract]-[assetId] for tracking and auditing.

## Automated Sync Links

Sync links establish persistent connections between your data systems and on-chain state. Connect your existing API endpoints without modifying backend infrastructure, map your data fields to blockchain-compatible formats with flexible transformation rules, configure synchronization frequency or custom execution triggers, and test thoroughly with sample data before production deployment.

### Field Mapping Configuration

Map your backend data structure to required on-chain formats through the issuer portal's visual mapper or API configuration:
```json
{
  "backend_valuation_field": "valuation",
  "internal_risk_metric": "riskScore1", 
  "secondary_risk_metric": "riskScore2",
  "asset_identifier": "name",
  "location_data": "physicalLocation",
  "last_audit_date": "verificationTimestamp"
}
```

The system handles type conversion, unit normalization, and validation automatically. Configure multiple mappings per sync link for complex data structures or multi-source aggregation.

### Advanced Execution Hooks

Trigger data updates during specific on-chain events for atomic operations. When a user requests a loan against gold tokens, the loan request transaction executes the sync link in the same transaction—fetching current gold prices, updating collateral valuation, calculating loan-to-value ratio, and approving or rejecting the loan atomically without separate transactions.

Configure hooks for transfer events updating asset ownership records, minting operations refreshing supply and valuation data, compliance checks triggering risk score updates, and corporate actions synchronizing dividend or redemption information. All hooks execute within the triggering transaction preventing stale data and race conditions.

Other common triggers include price updates before liquidation calculations, risk score refreshes during loan origination, metadata updates when documents change, and compliance data synchronization for regulatory reporting.

### Synchronization Frequency

Set update intervals based on asset volatility and operational requirements. High-frequency assets like stocks or commodities sync every block or minute. Stable assets like real estate sync daily or weekly. Custom triggers override scheduled updates when specific conditions occur on-chain.

The system tracks last update timestamp and prevents redundant calls. Configure minimum time between updates to optimize gas costs while maintaining data freshness. Set maximum staleness limits failing operations if data exceeds configured age.

## Automation Vault

Enable fully automated synchronization without manual transaction signing or gas management. Deposit ETH into the automation vault contract, connect sync links to the vault for gasless execution, and automated keepers handle all transactions with optimized gas pricing. A 10% keeper incentive ensures reliable execution even during network congestion.

The vault monitors your balance and alerts before depletion. Refill anytime through the issuer portal or direct contract interaction. Withdraw unused balance whenever sync links are paused or removed. All vault operations emit events for accounting and monitoring integration.

Benefits include elimination of manual transaction signing, automatic gas price optimization across network conditions, continuous data updates without operational overhead, and transparent balance monitoring with low-balance alerts.

## On-Chain Storage

Asset verifications store complete metadata on-chain for transparency and composability. Each verification includes a unique reference ID in RWA-[contract]-[assetId] format, institutional signature proving data source, submission timestamp for freshness validation, expiration date for automatic staleness handling, and full asset metadata including valuations and risk scores.

Smart contracts query this data during operations requiring current valuations—loan issuance checks collateral value, liquidations verify underwater positions, and transfers validate compliance requirements. Historical data remains accessible for auditing and dispute resolution.

## Data Integrity

Institutional signatures prove data authenticity without requiring multi-party consensus. Financial institutions sign submissions with authorized keys configured during token deployment. Only whitelisted institutions can submit verifications for their assets—your bank updates your asset data, not external parties.

Set expiration dates forcing periodic re-verification. Stale data fails validation automatically protecting users from outdated valuations. Configure expiration duration based on asset stability—volatile assets require frequent updates while stable assets tolerate longer intervals.

This trust model works because financial institutions face regulatory oversight and reputational risk. Submitting false data violates compliance requirements and damages institutional credibility. Unlike decentralized oracles requiring consensus, institutional data feeds provide direct accountability.

## Testing Environment

Test sync links with sample data before production deployment. The platform provides test endpoints for AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL stock data simulating real market feeds. Validate field mapping accuracy, execution timing, and error handling without risking production operations or spending mainnet gas.

Submit test verifications visible only in staging environments. Test automated triggers by simulating loan requests or transfer events. Verify gas estimation and keeper execution before enabling automated sync links on mainnet.

## Institutional Responsibility

Your institution assumes responsibility for submitted data accuracy. Implement proper validation before submitting verifications—verify data sources are authoritative, implement sanity checks preventing obvious errors, maintain audit logs for regulatory compliance, and configure access controls limiting who can trigger submissions.

Incorrect valuations can cause improper liquidations, unfair trades, or compliance violations. Test thoroughly and monitor production submissions for anomalies. Maintain off-chain records matching on-chain submissions for dispute resolution and regulatory audits.

<Warning>
Synchronized data directly affects user funds through collateral valuations and liquidation triggers. Implement multiple validation layers and monitoring before deploying production sync links.
