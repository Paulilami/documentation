Our automation vaults allow clients to automate any contract-related operation directly from their backend. They only have to setup their Instance Vault Contract (IVC), deposit mainnet tokens, and start signing approved operations.

Another crucial component of our automation relayer are **synchronization links**. These links are direct connections from the clients bankend to the on-chain receiving contract for continues data / price feeds. Clients can setup custom synchronization hooks, for example: A hook that gathers the off-chain gold price for a redemption when requested.
