Our [ERC-4337](/new/learn/automation/erc-4337-integration)-based vaults allow clients to automate any contract-related operation directly from their backend. They only have to setup their [Instance Vault Contract](/new/learn/automation/architecture) (IVC), deposit mainnet tokens, and start signing approved operations with just an API call.

Another crucial component of our automation relayer are [synchronization links](/new/learn/automation/synchronization-links). These links are direct connections from the clients bankend to the on-chain receiving contract for continues data / price feeds. Clients can setup custom synchronization hooks, for example: A hook that gathers the off-chain gold price for a redemption when requested.
