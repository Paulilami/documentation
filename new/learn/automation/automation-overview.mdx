Our [ERC-4337](/new/learn/automation/erc-4337-integration)-based vaults allow clients to automate any contract-related operation directly from their backend. They only have to setup their [Instance Vault Contract](/new/learn/automation/architecture) (IVC), deposit mainnet tokens, and start signing approved operations with just an API call.

A vital component of our automation relayer is [synchronization links](/new/learn/automation/synchronization-links). These links establish a direct connection between your backend and on-chain contracts for continuous data and price feeds. You can configure custom execution hooks that run atomically. For instance, fetching real-time off-chain gold prices the exact moment a redemption is requested.
