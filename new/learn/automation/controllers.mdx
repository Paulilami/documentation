Instance Vault Contracts automate every administrative function across your tokenization infrastructure. Enable specific operations with rate limits and let your backend execute them without manual wallet signatures. All operations route through the IVC's validation system with full audit trails.

Set daily limits during function enablement or update them anytime through owner operations. Zero indicates unlimited calls while any positive number enforces the specified cap. The IVC tracks usage automatically and rejects operations exceeding configured limits.

## Batch Operations

Execute multiple operations in a single transaction for gas efficiency and atomic execution.

<ParamField path="executeBatch" type="function">

</ParamField>

Batch execution validates all operations before executing any, ensuring atomic success or complete revert. This prevents partial state changes and maintains consistency across multi-step workflows. All operations in a batch must pass individual function enablement and rate limit checks.
