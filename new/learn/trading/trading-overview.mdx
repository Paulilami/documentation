Trading infrastructure adapts to asset characteristics. Fungible securities trade through automated market makers while unique assets require fixed-price listings. Both approaches enforce the same compliance rules and settle instantly on-chain.

Financial institutions choose their integration model based on operational requirements. Automated market makers suit high-frequency trading with continuous liquidity, while listing-based markets match traditional order book behavior for less liquid assets.

AMM pools maintain continuous two-sided liquidity through algorithmic pricing that responds to supply and demand. Listing markets let sellers set prices and wait for matching buyers, enabling price discovery without requiring deep liquidity pools.

<Note>
Custom token integration requires pool initialization with proper liquidity ratios and a price feed. Integrate feeds directly or use synchronization links to external data sources.

## Integration Paths

Create trading pools through the issuer dashboard or directly via API. Both paths require initial liquidity funding with paired tokens—typically your security token against USDC or another stablecoin. Choose your integration approach based on technical architecture:

**White Label Platform:** Pre-built trading interface that automatically detects and displays all pools approved for your instance. Users trade directly within the white label environment without additional development work.

**API Integration:** Direct smart contract interaction through REST endpoints. Build custom trading experiences in your existing applications while leveraging Trusset's settlement infrastructure and compliance validation.

All pools enforce identity verification and transfer restrictions before execution. Trades settle atomically—either complete fully or revert entirely, preventing partial fills or orphaned state.
