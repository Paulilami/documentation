Asset Financing transforms tokenized securities into structured loans where sellers become lenders. Buyers make down payments and monthly installments while tokens remain in smart contract escrow until full payment completion.

## Mortgage Infrastructure

The financing system operates through decentralized mortgage contracts that handle escrow, payment processing, interest calculation, and default resolution without intermediaries.

Tokens lock in escrow during the payment period. Buyers gain beneficial ownership rights (dividends, governance if applicable) but cannot transfer or sell until final payment completes. This structure protects sellers while enabling buyer participation in asset performance.

## Down Payment Structure

Down payment percentage inversely correlates with interest rates and maximum loan duration. Lower down payments increase seller risk, reflected in higher interest charges.

| Down Payment | Interest Rate | Max Duration | Use Case |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 25-40% | 12-15% APR | 5 years | Aggressive financing for high-confidence buyers |
| 40-60% | 8-12% APR | 10 years | Balanced approach for standard credit profiles |
| 60-80% | 4-8% APR | 30 years | Conservative financing minimizing seller risk |

Sellers configure acceptable down payment ranges when enabling financing on listings. Buyers select their preferred down payment within allowed bounds during purchase, with contract calculating interest rates automatically.

<Accordion title="Interest Rate Calculation">
The mortgage manager calculates rates using tiered formulas based on down payment percentage:

```typescript
function calculateInterestRate(downPaymentBps: number): number {
    // downPaymentBps in basis points (4000 = 40%)
    
    if (downPaymentBps < 4000) {
        // 25-40% down: 12-15% APR
        const range = 4000 - 2500; // 1500 bps range
        const position = downPaymentBps - 2500;
        return 1500 - ((position * 300) / range); // 15% to 12%
    } else if (downPaymentBps < 6000) {
        // 40-60% down: 8-12% APR
        const range = 6000 - 4000; // 2000 bps range
        const position = downPaymentBps - 4000;
        return 1200 - ((position * 400) / range); // 12% to 8%
    } else {
        // 60-80% down: 4-8% APR
        const range = 8000 - 6000; // 2000 bps range
        const position = downPaymentBps - 6000;
        return 800 - ((position * 400) / range); // 8% to 4%
    }
}
```

This algorithm ensures smooth rate transitions across tiers while incentivizing higher down payments through better terms.

## Payment Processing

Monthly payments process automatically through smart contract execution. Buyers authorize recurring payments or manually trigger monthly installments before due dates.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Initiate Financed Purchase
// POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/financing/purchase

const response = await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/financing/purchase', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    listingId: "listing_abc123",
    downPaymentBps: 5000, // 50%
    durationMonths: 36, // 3 years
    paymentToken: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
    enableAutoPayment: true // Authorize automatic monthly deductions
  })
});

const { mortgageId, monthlyPayment, totalInterest } = await response.json();
```

```typescript Make Manual Payment
// POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/financing/pay

await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/financing/pay', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    mortgageId: "mortgage_xyz789",
    paymentAmount: "3500000000" // 3,500 USDC
  })
});

// Can pay more than monthly amount for early payoff
// Excess applies to principal reduction
```
</CodeGroup>

Automated payments require initial token approval allowing the mortgage contract to deduct monthly amounts. Manual payments offer flexibility for irregular income or early payoff strategies.

## Mortgage Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase Initiation">
    Buyer selects down payment percentage and loan duration within seller's parameters. Smart contract calculates monthly payment based on interest rate formula.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Down Payment & Escrow">
    Buyer transfers down payment to seller immediately. Token locks in mortgage escrow contract until full payment completion.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monthly Payments">
    Buyer makes scheduled monthly payments containing principal and interest. Contract tracks remaining balance and payment history on-chain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Completion">
    Final payment triggers automatic token transfer from escrow to buyer. Mortgage marked complete, seller receives final installment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Early Payoff (Optional)">
    Buyer can pay remaining balance anytime without prepayment penalties. Token releases immediately upon full payment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Default Handling

Missed payments trigger grace periods before default declaration. Sellers receive multiple protections ensuring capital recovery even in default scenarios.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Grace Period">
        Buyers get 15-day grace periods after payment due dates. Late fees accrue during grace periods (typically 5% of payment amount) but default doesn't trigger until grace expires.

        ```typescript
        // Payment due: Day 1
        // Grace period: Days 1-15
        // Late fee: 5% of monthly payment
        // Default trigger: Day 16 if unpaid
        ```
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Default Declaration">
        After grace period expiration without payment, contract automatically declares default. Token returns to seller from escrow, buyer loses all paid amounts including down payment.

        ```typescript
        // POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/financing/default

        await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/financing/default', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify({
            mortgageId: "mortgage_xyz789"
          })
        });

        // Results:
        // - Token returns to seller
        // - Seller keeps: down payment + all past payments + 2.5% penalty
        // - Buyer receives: nothing
        // - Credit mark recorded on-chain
        ```
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Credit Impact">
        Defaults record permanently on-chain, creating decentralized credit histories. Future sellers can query buyer default history before approving financing terms.

        ```typescript
        // GET https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/financing/credit/{address}

        const creditHistory = await fetch(
          `https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/financing/credit/${buyerAddress}`,
          { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}` } }
        ).then(r => r.json());

        // Returns:
        // - totalMortgages: number
        // - completedOnTime: number
        // - defaults: number
        // - averageDownPayment: number
        // - creditScore: calculated 0-1000
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Defaults are irreversible once declared. Buyers lose all paid amounts including down payment with no refund mechanism. This strict enforcement ensures seller protection and discourages strategic defaults.
</Warning>

## Seller Protections

Multiple mechanisms protect sellers from buyer default risk while enabling financing options that expand potential buyer pools.

**Immediate Down Payment:** Sellers receive 25-80% of asset value upfront, reducing exposure to only the financed portion.

**Collateral Security:** Tokens remain in escrow throughout payment period—sellers maintain legal ownership until final payment.

**Default Penalties:** On default, sellers keep all received payments plus 2.5% penalty fee calculated on remaining balance.

**Credit Verification:** Query on-chain credit histories before approving financing to assess buyer reliability.

**Early Payoff Benefits:** Buyers can pay early without penalties, reducing seller's capital lockup period.

## Configuration Options

Sellers customize financing terms per listing, controlling risk exposure and return expectations.

<ParamField path="minDownPayment" type="uint256">
  Minimum acceptable down payment in basis points (2500 = 25%)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="maxDownPayment" type="uint256">
  Maximum down payment before requiring instant purchase (8000 = 80%)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="maxDuration" type="uint256">
  Longest acceptable loan term in months (60 = 5 years)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="enableAutoPayment" type="bool">
  Whether to require or allow automatic monthly deductions
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="creditScoreMinimum" type="uint256">
  Minimum on-chain credit score for financing eligibility (optional)
</ParamField>

Tighter restrictions reduce default risk but limit buyer access. More flexible terms expand the market but increase exposure to payment failures.
