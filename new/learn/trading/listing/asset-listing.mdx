Listings enable direct peer-to-peer trading of non-fungible tokens at seller-determined prices. Create fixed-price offers, accept financing terms, or configure instant-buy options—all enforced through smart contract escrow with compliance validation at execution.

## Supported Token Standards

Listings work across multiple non-fungible token implementations with unified trading interfaces:

**ERC-721:** Standard NFTs with unique token identifiers and single-owner architecture. Each listing represents one token with complete ownership transfer on purchase.

**ERC-1155:** Multi-token standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible assets. Listings specify quantity for partial or full position sales from single contract addresses.

**ERC-1400 Security Tokens:** Partition-based ownership with granular compliance rules. Listings enforce identity verification, transfer restrictions, and regulatory requirements automatically during execution.

All standards integrate with the same marketplace contracts, enabling consistent user experiences regardless of underlying token architecture.

## Listing Creation

Sellers configure price, payment options, and buyer requirements when creating listings. The marketplace validates token ownership and transfer approval before activating listings.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Create Listing via API
// POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/listings/create

const response = await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/listings/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    tokenAddress: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
    tokenId: "1", // For ERC-721/ERC-1400
    amount: "1", // For ERC-1155 quantity
    pricePerUnit: "50000000000", // 50,000 USDC
    paymentToken: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
    enableFinancing: true,
    minDownPayment: 40, // 40% minimum
    maxDuration: 60, // 60 months max
    instantBuy: true
  })
});

const { listingId, escrowAddress } = await response.json();
```

```typescript Update Listing
// PATCH https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/listings/{listingId}

await fetch(`https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/listings/${listingId}`, {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    pricePerUnit: "55000000000", // Update price
    enableFinancing: false, // Disable financing
    instantBuy: true // Keep instant buy enabled
  })
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Tokens transfer to marketplace escrow upon listing creation. This prevents double-selling and ensures atomic settlement—buyers receive tokens immediately upon payment without requiring separate seller actions.

## Purchase Execution

Buyers select payment method during purchase—instant full payment or structured financing with down payments. The marketplace validates compliance, processes payment, and transfers tokens atomically.

<Accordion title="Instant Purchase Flow">
1. **Compliance Check:** Validate buyer KYC status and token transfer restrictions
2. **Payment Transfer:** Move payment token from buyer to seller
3. **Token Release:** Transfer listed token from escrow to buyer
4. **Fee Distribution:** Deduct marketplace fees and route to platform wallet
5. **Event Emission:** Record trade details on-chain for analytics

All steps execute in a single transaction—either complete fully or revert entirely. Failed compliance checks prevent wasted gas by rejecting before payment processing.
</Accordion>

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Instant Buy">
        Full payment processes immediately with atomic token transfer. Buyer pays listing price plus marketplace fees (typically 2.5%) in a single transaction.

        ```typescript
        // POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/listings/buy

        await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/listings/buy', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify({
            listingId: "listing_abc123",
            paymentMethod: "instant",
            maxSlippage: 0 // Fixed price, no slippage
          })
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Financed Purchase">
        Structured payment with down payment and monthly installments. Tokens remain in escrow during payment period, transferring to buyer upon final payment completion.

        ```typescript
        // POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/listings/buy

        await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/trading/listings/buy', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify({
            listingId: "listing_abc123",
            paymentMethod: "financing",
            downPayment: 50, // 50% down
            durationMonths: 36, // 3 years
            autoPayment: true // Enable automatic monthly deductions
          })
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Listing Management

Sellers modify active listings, cancel unsold offers, or accept specific buyer proposals through management functions.

<ParamField path="updatePrice" type="function">
  Change listing price without canceling—useful for price discovery or responding to market conditions
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="cancelListing" type="function">
  Remove listing and return tokens from escrow to seller immediately
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="updateFinancingTerms" type="function">
  Adjust minimum down payment, maximum duration, or disable financing entirely
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="pauseListing" type="function">
  Temporarily hide listing without canceling—useful during negotiations or compliance review
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="acceptOffer" type="function">
  Approve specific buyer proposal if listing configured for offer acceptance
</ParamField>

Listing modifications emit events that update marketplace interfaces in real-time. Buyers see current terms without requiring manual refresh or blockchain queries.

## Compliance Integration

Listings enforce token-level compliance automatically. Every purchase validates identity verification, transfer restrictions, and wallet limits before executing trades.

| Compliance Check | Validation | Failure Action |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| KYC Verification | Query identity registry for buyer status | Reject transaction before payment |
| Transfer Restrictions | Check token whitelist/blacklist mappings | Revert with restriction reason |
| Wallet Limits | Validate buyer won't exceed maximum holdings | Prevent purchase with limit error |
| Freeze Status | Confirm neither party frozen by issuer | Reject and notify both parties |

All validation occurs on-chain during transaction execution. Failed checks revert the entire transaction, preventing partial state changes or orphaned payments.

<Warning>
Sellers must ensure tokens have proper transfer approval before listing. Without approval, the marketplace cannot move tokens to escrow, causing listing creation to fail.
</Warning>

## Marketplace Fees

Platform charges configurable fees on completed trades, typically 2.5% of transaction value. Fees split between marketplace operator and platform infrastructure based on instance configuration.

```typescript
// Fee calculation example
const listingPrice = 50000_000000; // 50,000 USDC
const marketplaceFee = 250; // 2.5% in bps
const feeAmount = (listingPrice * marketplaceFee) / 10000;
// feeAmount = 1,250 USDC

const sellerReceives = listingPrice - feeAmount;
// sellerReceives = 48,750 USDC
```

Fee configuration happens at instance level through the Issuer Platform. Different token types or categories can have varying fee structures to accommodate asset-specific economics.

## Instance Isolation

Listings operate within instance boundaries—only tokens issued in the same instance appear in the marketplace. This maintains compliance separation and prevents cross-contamination between unrelated token ecosystems.

Buyers and sellers must both hold verified identities within the instance to participate. Cross-instance trading requires explicit bridge mechanisms or multi-instance identity verification.
