description: "Overcollateralized lending markets that transform tokenized assets into instant liquidity"
---

Lending markets enable financial institutions to operate automated credit facilities where users borrow USDC against tokenized assets. Deposit security tokens as collateral, receive instant loans, and maintain asset ownership while accessing liquidity.

<Note>
Our lending v2 APIs are coming soon. Financial institutions can currently manage lending markets through the Issuers App, with full API v2 access launching shortly.

## How It Works

<Steps>
    <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
        Users deposit tokenized assets (stocks, commodities, real estate tokens) into your lending market as collateral
    </Step>
    <Step title="Receive Loan">
        The market calculates borrowing capacity based on collateral value and configured loan-to-value ratios, then issues USDC instantly
    </Step>
    <Step title="Interest Accrues">
        Interest accumulates continuously based on market utilization—higher demand automatically increases rates
    </Step>
    <Step title="Repay or Liquidate">
        Users repay anytime to unlock collateral. If collateral value drops below safety thresholds, automated liquidation protects the pool
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts

### Health Factor

The health factor measures position safety. It compares collateral value against outstanding debt:

$$
\text{Health Factor} = \frac{\text{Collateral Value} \times \text{Liquidation Threshold}}{\text{Total Debt}}
$$

- **Health Factor > 1**: Position is safe
- **Health Factor < 1**: Position can be liquidated

### Collateral Factor vs Liquidation Threshold

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Collateral Factor | Maximum borrowing power | 75% means $10,000 collateral = $7,500 max borrow |
| Liquidation Threshold | Safety buffer before liquidation | 85% provides a 10% buffer above collateral factor |

This gap gives borrowers time to add collateral or repay debt before liquidation triggers.

### Interest Rate Model

Interest rates adjust automatically based on pool utilization:

$$
\text{Utilization} = \frac{\text{Total Borrowed}}{\text{Total Deposits}}
$$

Low utilization = lower rates (encouraging borrowing). High utilization = higher rates (encouraging deposits and repayments).

## Revenue Model

Institutions earn the spread between what borrowers pay and what liquidity providers receive.

<Accordion title="Example Revenue Calculation">
**Pool Configuration:**
- Total deposits: $1,000,000
- Total borrowed: $600,000
- Utilization: 60%

**Rate Structure:**
- Borrow APY: 8%
- Supply APY: 5.5%
- Protocol spread: 2.5%

**Annual Revenue:**
- Interest collected: $600,000 × 8% = $48,000
- Interest paid to LPs: $1,000,000 × 5.5% = $55,000 (weighted by utilization)
- Protocol revenue: ~$15,000 annually from this single pool

Additional revenue from liquidation penalties (typically 5% of liquidated collateral value).

## Integration Options

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Borrow Module">
        Add our Borrow Module to your whitelabel application. It automatically fetches your approved lending markets and provides a complete borrowing interface for your users.
        
        Users can:
        - View available markets and rates
        - Deposit collateral and borrow
        - Monitor position health
        - Repay and withdraw
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Online Banking Integration">
        Embed "Borrow Against Assets" directly in your digital banking interface using our APIs. Users access lending without leaving your platform.
        
        Your backend handles blockchain interactions transparently—users see familiar banking flows.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="API-Only">
        Build fully custom interfaces using REST APIs while leveraging Trusset's smart contract infrastructure for all on-chain operations.
        
        Maximum flexibility for institutions with specific UX requirements.

## Liquidity Sources

Liquidity providers (usually the institution deploying the contracts) deposit stablecoins into lending markets, earning yield on their capital. Providers receive LP shares representing their pool ownership-share value increases as interest accumulates.

<Info>
Anyone can deposit liquidiy alongside institutional providers and earn a stable yield.

## Instance Isolation

Each lending market operates in complete isolation:
- Separate smart contracts per market
- Independent configuration and risk parameters
- No cross-market exposure
- Full regulatory separation between institutions

Bank A's lending markets never interact with Bank B's markets, maintaining clean risk boundaries and compliance segregation.
