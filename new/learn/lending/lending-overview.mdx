description: "Overcollateralized lending markets that transform tokenized assets into instant liquidity"
---

Lending markets enable financial institutions to operate automated credit facilities where users borrow against tokenized assets. Deposit security tokens as collateral, receive instant USDC loans, and maintain asset ownership while accessing liquidity.
<Note>
You can pair any ERC20-based token with your lending market, USDC is not required and only used as an example.
</Note>
Banks earn interest on every loan without manual underwriting or payment collection. The infrastructure handles risk management, liquidations, and compliance automatically—creating new revenue streams from existing tokenized asset portfolios.

## How It Works

Users deposit tokenized assets into lending markets as collateral. The market values collateral using oracle prices from trading pools, calculating maximum borrowing capacity based on configured loan-to-value ratios.

Borrowers receive USDC loans instantly against their locked collateral. Interest accrues continuously based on utilization rates—higher borrowing demand increases rates automatically, incentivizing more liquidity provision.

If collateral value drops and loan-to-value ratios exceed liquidation thresholds, liquidators repay debt and seize collateral at discounted prices. This protects lenders while maintaining market solvency.

<Accordion title="Lending Flow Example">
User owns 100 tokenized gold tokens valued at $200 each:

**Step 1: Deposit Collateral**
- Deposits 100 tokens worth $20,000
- Market applies 75% collateral factor
- Maximum borrowing capacity: $15,000

**Step 2: Borrow**
- User borrows $10,000 USDC
- Initial LTV: 50% ($10,000 / $20,000)
- Interest begins accruing at current rate (e.g., 8% APR)

**Step 3: Interest Accrual**
- After 30 days: $66 interest accumulated
- Total debt: $10,066
- Current LTV: ~50.3%

**Step 4: Repayment**
- User repays $10,066 USDC
- Collateral unlocks and returns to user
- Position closes automatically

**Alternative: Price Drop**
- Gold price drops to $150
- Collateral value: $15,000
- LTV rises to 67%
- Approaching 80% liquidation threshold
- User must either add collateral or repay debt

## Market Architecture

Each financial institution deploys independent lending markets for their tokenized assets. Markets operate in isolation—Bank A's lending market doesn't interact with Bank B's market, maintaining regulatory separation and risk boundaries.

Institutions configure collateral acceptance, loan-to-value ratios, liquidation thresholds, and interest rate models per asset type. Gold tokens might accept 75% LTV while real estate tokens require 60% LTV based on volatility expectations.

## Integration Options

**Online Banking Integration:** Add "Borrow" buttons directly in digital banking interfaces. Users deposit assets from their wallets and receive loans without leaving your platform. Backend APIs handle all blockchain interactions transparently.

**Standalone Platform:** Deploy dedicated lending interfaces separate from core banking systems. Users access lending markets through white-label platforms that maintain your branding and compliance controls.

**API-Only:** Build custom interfaces using REST APIs while leveraging Trusset's smart contract infrastructure for collateral management, liquidations, and interest calculations.

<Note>
Operating lending markets requires appropriate regulatory licenses for credit provision. Typically only licensed banks or financial institutions with lending authority can deploy these markets legally.

## Revenue Model

Banks earn the spread between borrowing rates and liquidity provider returns. When users borrow at 8% APR, liquidity providers might earn 6% APR with the 2% spread covering operational costs and generating profit.

Interest accrues continuously with no minimum loan terms or prepayment penalties. Users repay anytime, with excess payments reducing principal immediately. This flexibility increases usage while maintaining predictable returns for institutions.

Liquidation penalties provide additional revenue—when positions liquidate, the bank earns the spread between liquidation threshold and actual liquidation execution price.

## Risk Management

Overcollateralization protects against borrower defaults. Every loan requires collateral value exceeding debt by configured safety margins—typically 125-150% depending on asset volatility.

Automated liquidations trigger when positions approach insolvency. Liquidation bots monitor health factors continuously, executing liquidations before losses occur. This removes manual risk assessment and collection processes entirely.

Insurance funds absorb rare losses from rapid price movements. A portion of interest revenue flows to insurance reserves that cover bad debt when liquidations fail to recover full loan amounts.
