Once your lending market is live, the Issuers App provides tools for monitoring positions, managing liquidity, tracking transactions, and adjusting configuration. Most operations are observable—the market runs autonomously while you maintain oversight.

## Dashboard Overview

The market detail view displays real-time metrics:

    </Card>
    <Card title="Total Borrowed" icon="arrow-up">

    </Card>
    <Card title="Utilization" icon="percent">

## Monitoring Positions

### Position List

The **Positions** tab shows all active loans:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| User | Borrower wallet address |
| Borrowed | Outstanding debt (principal + interest) |
| Collateral | Locked token amount |
| Interest | Accrued interest to date |
| Health | Current health factor |
| Status | Active, At Risk, or Liquidated |

### Health Factor Alerts

Positions are color-coded by risk:

- 🟢 **Green (> 1.2)**: Healthy, well-collateralized
- 🟡 **Yellow (1.0 - 1.2)**: Approaching threshold, may need monitoring
- 🔴 **Red (< 1.0)**: Liquidatable

<Info>
The system sends notifications when positions approach liquidation thresholds. Configure webhook endpoints in your instance settings to receive these alerts.
</Info>

### Position Details

Click any position to view:

- Full transaction history
- Price at borrow vs current price
- Collateral value over time
- Interest accumulation
- Liquidation price (price at which position becomes unhealthy)

## Liquidity Management

### Providing Liquidity

The **Provide** button opens the liquidity modal:

1. Enter USDC amount
2. Confirm transaction from connected wallet
3. Receive LP shares representing pool ownership

LP shares appreciate as interest accumulates—withdrawing later returns more USDC than deposited.

### Withdrawing Liquidity

The **Withdraw** button converts shares back to USDC:

1. Enter share amount or USDC value
2. System calculates current share value
3. Confirm withdrawal

<Warning>
Withdrawals require available liquidity. If most USDC is borrowed, withdrawals may be limited until borrowers repay or get liquidated.
</Warning>

### Provider Tracking

The **Providers** tab lists all liquidity providers:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Provider | Wallet address |
| Deposited | Original USDC deposit |
| Shares | Current share balance |
| Value | Current USDC value of shares |
| Status | Active or Withdrawn |

## Oracle Management

### Price Synchronization

**Automated:**
Click _**Authorize Signer**_ to automate price feeds with our backend relayer (no funding required). We will soon implement the [IVC](/new/learn/automation/architecture) to automate price-feeds for lending.

**Manual:**
Click _**Sync Oracle**_ to update the on-chain price:

1. System fetches current price from configured feed
2. Signs price update with authorized signer
3. Submits to oracle contract
4. New price becomes effective immediately

### Stale Price Handling

If the oracle price becomes stale (exceeds max age):

- New borrows are blocked
- Existing positions continue operating
- Liquidations use last valid price
- Alert appears prompting price sync

### Price History

View historical prices in the position detail view. The chart shows:

- Oracle price over time
- Position-specific liquidation price
- Current market price from external feeds

## Transaction History

The **Transactions** tab logs all market activity:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DEPOSIT | Liquidity provider deposit |
| WITHDRAW | Liquidity withdrawal |
| BORROW | New loan opened |
| REPAY | Debt repayment |
| LIQUIDATE | Position liquidation |
| CONFIGURATION | Settings change |

Each transaction links to the block explorer for verification.

## Configuration Updates

### Risk Parameters

Go to the tab **Settings → Edit Config** to modify:

<Accordion title="Modifiable Parameters">
| Parameter | Live Update | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Collateral Factor | ✅ | Affects new borrows only |
| Liquidation Threshold | ✅ | Changes health factor calculations |
| Liquidation Penalty | ✅ | Applies to future liquidations |
| Close Factor | ✅ | Limits liquidation size |
| Min Borrow Amount | ✅ | Filters small loans |
| Supply Caps | ✅ | Can increase or decrease |
| Dutch Auction Toggle | ✅ | Switches liquidation mode |
| Auction Duration | ✅ | For new auctions only |
| Auction Premiums | ✅ | For new auctions only |
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Lowering the liquidation threshold can make healthy positions suddenly liquidatable. Review position health factors before reducing thresholds.
</Warning>

### Trading Venue

Configure where liquidated collateral goes for sale:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Default Orderbook">
        Uses Trusset's built-in orderbook. Liquidated tokens list automatically, and USDC proceeds return to the lending pool.
        
        Recommended for most deployments.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Custom Venue">
        Route liquidated collateral to your own trading contract, AMM, or OTC desk.
        
        Requirements:
        - Must accept the collateral token
        - Must return USDC to the liquidation router
        - Must implement the settlement interface
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Custom Price Feed

Override default price sources:
```
https://your-api.com/price?symbol={symbol}
```

The API must return JSON with a price field. Test your endpoint in the interface before configuring, invalid feeds will cause oracle sync failures.

## Alerts and Notifications

The dashboard shows contextual alerts:

| Alert | Action Required |
|-------|-----------------|
| Signer Not Authorized | Connect owner wallet and authorize |
| Oracle Price Stale | Sync oracle price |
| Liquidation Not Configured | Complete liquidation setup |
| Pending Liquidations | Monitor or trigger settlement |
| Active Auctions | Auctions in progress, can bid |

## Emergency Controls

### Pausing

Admins can pause the market during emergencies:

- Stops new loans and borrows
- Allows repayments (users can exit)
- Liquidations continue (protects pool)
- Liquidity withdrawals permitted

Pause when: suspicious activity detected, contract upgrade needed, or external market conditions warrant caution.

### Upgrading

Contract upgrades require Admin role:

1. Deploy new implementation
2. Call upgrade function with new address
3. Verify functionality in staging first

<Danger>
Contract upgrades are irreversible. Always test on testnet with identical conditions before production upgrades.
</Danger>
