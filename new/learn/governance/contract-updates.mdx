Trusset operates via the TrussetDAO, where the Trusset UG proposes new updates. Issuers (verified financial institutions), have to sign each proposal. 

## What gets updated?

Trusset never updates your deployed smart contracts, we provide a simplified conversion mechanism (based on the update) that allows each issuer to independently convert to a new update or reject it. Direct updates only occur in factories and utility contracts without altering your existing deployments.

## Independent Updates

<Warning>When updating your smart contracts with a custom update, ensure that the the interface matches the technical- and legal requirements</Warning>

Smart contracts can be updated independently by the issuer with own changes or implementations to match their needs on the contract / asset side.
