title: "Trusset Governance"
---

The Trusset Governance protocol is based on a simple `GnosisSafe` multisignature approval process with licensed issuers who decided to participate in the DAO for verifying proposed updates. 

<Note>Please note: To legally stay a technology provider, we are not allowed to independently push updates without a licenced entity approving it.</Note>

## Participants
To participate in the Trusset DAO, clients have to send a request to [hello@trusset.de](mailto:hello@trusset.de) or use our [contact form](https://www.trusset.org/contact). We will add their wallet to the participants, allowing them to vote on future updates. 

## Update-Only Governance 
The Trusset DAO is used for protocol updates only. The DAO cannot perfom asset- or customer-specific operations.
