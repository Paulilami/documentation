title: "Trusset Governance"
---

The Trusset Governance protocol is based on a simple `GnosisSafe` multisignature approval process with licensed issuers who decided to participate in the DAO for verifying proposed updates. 

<Note>Please note: To legally stay a technology provider, we are not allowed to independently push updated without a licenced entity approving it.</Note>

## Participants
To participate in the Trusset DAO, you have to send a request to our email [hello@trusset.de](mailto:hello@trusset.de) or use our [contact form](https://www.trusset.org/contact). We will add your wallet to the participants, allowing you to vote on future update proposals and general protocol decisions. 

## Update-Only Governance 
The Trusset DAO is only used for protocol updates, ensuring compliant updates. The DAO cannot perfom asset- or customer-specific operations like asset freezes or force transfers, this can only be done by the configured admin or authority address.
