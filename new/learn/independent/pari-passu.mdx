title: "Pari Passu"
description: "Uncollateralized lending structure with tokenized debt."
---

Pari Passu allows institutions to borrow directly from a committee of stakers. When stakers approve a loan, they receive a tradeable asset representing their claim on the provided collateral and future interest revenue. This turns a standard loan into a liquid investment that can be sold at any time.

<Note>Pari Passu currently runs on Solana Devnet, the application is not fully functional and should only provide an interface prototype.</Note>
