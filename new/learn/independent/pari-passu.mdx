title: "Pari Passu"
description: "Uncollateralized lending structure with tokenized debt."
---

Pari Passu is one of our deeper research projects, allowing high-qualisty borrowers (institutions) to request a loan from a committee of stakers that vote on loan requests and get utility token for a yes vote. This utility token represents the access to the provided collateral, and the earnings of that loan (access token) - its ERC20-based, so tradeable at any time.

<Note>Pari Passu currently runs on Solana Devnet, the applicatioon is **not** fully functional and should only provide an interface prototype.</Note>
