![ID verification integration in issuance interface](/images/id.png)

## System Architecture

Our customer management system operates on two core components: the [Identity Register](/new/learn/customers/identity-register) stores on-chain [identity proofs](/new/learn/customers/identity-proofs) that verify KYC and personal data without revealing it through zero-knowledge proofs. API integration allows you to verify customers directly from your backend, map existing data fields to on-chain identities, and process batch verifications of up to 500 customers with a single call.

## Instance-Based Relations

The identity registry is the only contract shared across all instances. Each issuer controls one identity registry used by all their instances, enabling consistent compliance enforcement while maintaining instance-specific customer data and notes in your backend. On-chain identity data remains universal across your instances for reliable verification.

## Verification Methods

### Third-Party Verification

Integration with Entrust provides automated KYC collection. Generate verification links with custom expiry periods from 24 hours to 30 days and send them to email or wallet addresses. Recipients complete identity verification through Entrust's secure portal and verification data records on-chain automatically upon completion, enabling immediate token transfers.

### Manual Verification

Verify customers directly by generating zero-knowledge on-chain proofs. This method requires your institution to assume full legal responsibility for verification accuracy. Input the wallet address, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, and optional expiry timestamp to create the verification.

### Batch Processing

Process up to 500 verifications per transaction through CSV upload or API submission. The system automatically chunks large batches to optimize gas costs, reducing expenses by 80% versus individual transactions.

## Integration Options

Access customer management through the issuer portal's visual dashboard displaying verification status, completion rates, and expiry tracking with export functionality for regulatory reporting. The interface provides link generation, bulk upload capabilities, real-time status monitoring, and automated email notifications.

For programmatic integration, use our [API](/api-intro) to verify customers, check verification status, and manage batch operations directly from your systems.

## Compliance Enforcement

Identity certificates integrate automatically with your token contracts. Transfer attempts from non-verified addresses fail with the revert message `KYC_NOT_VERIFIED`. The system adds a 5,000 gas pre-transfer verification check, enforces automatic expiry at block timestamp, shares verification across tokens within your instance, and enables jurisdiction-based transfer restrictions.

### Country-Specific Rules

Implement transfer restrictions based on stored country codes. Configure rules for US persons requiring accredited investor verification, EU residents needing MiCA compliance checks, or sanctioned countries requiring complete blocking with automatic rejection.

### Expiry and Revocation

Verifications include optional expiry timestamps checked on each transfer. Expired verifications require renewal through a new verification process. Revoke verification status for compliance violations or account closure—batch revocation supports up to 500 addresses simultaneously. Revoked addresses cannot receive tokens until re-verified.

<Warning>
Manual verification transfers legal liability to your institution. Ensure proper compliance procedures, documentation retention for minimum 7 years, and regular audits before enabling manual verification.
