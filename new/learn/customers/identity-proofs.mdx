description: "Zero-knowledge proofs that verify personal data without revealing or storing it on-chain."

Identity proofs confirm a person exists and their KYC data matches claimed attributes—without storing or exposing personal information on-chain. Data converts to cryptographic hashes before blockchain submission. Smart contracts verify these hashes during transfers without accessing underlying personal details.

## How Proofs Work

Personal data never touches the blockchain. Your system encrypts each data field—name, address, passport number, date of birth—converting it into a vector representation. These vectors generate corresponding SHA256 hashes stored on-chain as proofs. The original data remains in your secure systems while the blockchain verifies proof validity during token operations.

<Warning>
Issuers assume full legal responsibility for verification accuracy. Ensure proper compliance procedures and data validation before submitting proofs to the identity register.

## Creating Proofs

Generate identity proofs through manual verification in the issuer portal or programmatic API calls. Manual verification requires reviewing each data point and signing the proof with your authorized issuer key. API integration enables batch verification of up to 500 users in one transaction with custom field mapping, CSV upload, and automated workflows.

<Accordion title="Manual Verification Process">
Review customer documents in the issuer portal, confirm data accuracy against source documents, generate cryptographic hashes from verified data, sign the proof with your issuer key, and submit to the identity register for on-chain storage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Batch API Verification">
Map your existing customer database fields to required proof format, validate data completeness and format compliance, generate proofs for multiple customers simultaneously, submit batch transaction optimizing gas costs, and receive confirmation with proof identifiers for tracking.

## Identity Links

Organizations without KYC infrastructure or licensing use identity links for delegated verification. Generate a unique link through the issuer portal and send it to the customer via email or wallet address. The customer completes identity verification through our integrated KYC provider's secure portal. Verification data generates proofs automatically and submits to your identity register without manual intervention.

Identity links include configurable expiry periods from 24 hours to 30 days. Track link status—sent, opened, completed, or expired—through the dashboard. Resend links for expired or failed verifications without generating new proof requests.

## Customer Data Protection

Customers maintain ownership of personal data—issuers only manage verification and validation status. Your institution cannot access raw personal information stored by the KYC provider. Customers can request data deletion at any time, revoking verification status across all tokens. This architecture complies with GDPR and data privacy regulations requiring user control over personal information.

Proof revocation happens instantly through the identity register. Revoked proofs fail all future transfer attempts until the customer completes new verification. Batch revocation supports up to 500 addresses simultaneously for compliance enforcement or account closure scenarios.
