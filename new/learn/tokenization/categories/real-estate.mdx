Real Estate Tokens represent fractional ownership in SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) companies that hold physical properties. Each token grants proportional equity rights, dividend claims, and governance participation—transforming illiquid real estate into tradable securities with instant settlement and transparent ownership history.

## SPV Structure

Real Estate Tokens represent shares in a Special Purpose Vehicle—a legal entity created specifically to hold one property or portfolio. Token holders own equity in the SPV, which in turn owns the physical real estate. This structure separates property ownership from operational liabilities while enabling blockchain-based fractional ownership.

The SPV handles all legal obligations including property taxes, insurance, and regulatory compliance. Token holders receive dividends when the SPV distributes rental income or capital gains from property appreciation. The `documentUri` points to legal agreements, property deeds, valuation reports, and SPV formation documents that establish the connection between tokens and real property.

<Accordion title="On-Chain Property Records">
Real Estate Tokens maintain comprehensive property history directly on-chain:

- **Sales History**: Records of purchase prices and transaction dates for valuation tracking
- **Maintenance Records**: Documentation of repairs, upgrades, and capital improvements
- **Ownership History**: Historical record of equity transfers and stake percentages
- **Property Age**: Automated calculation from deployment timestamp for depreciation models

Administrators add records as events occur, creating an immutable audit trail that supports property valuations and due diligence processes. Future versions will include automated rent collection and distribution mechanisms currently in testing.

## Compliance & Transfer Controls

Real Estate Tokens extend Light Token architecture with comprehensive transfer restrictions that match regulatory requirements for security tokens and property ownership.

| Control Type | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Whitelist | Restrict transfers to accredited investors | On-chain address approval before any transfer |
| Blacklist | Block sanctioned or non-compliant addresses | Automatic transfer rejection for listed addresses |
| Freeze | Temporarily lock accounts during disputes | Individual account suspension by administrators |
| KYC Verification | Validate investor identity and accreditation | Integration with identity registry contracts |
| Wallet Limits | Prevent concentration of ownership | Maximum token balance enforced per address |

Administrators configure these controls at deployment based on jurisdiction and regulatory framework. The contract validates all restrictions before executing transfers, ensuring compliance without manual intervention.

## Dividend Management

Real Estate Tokens automate rental income and profit distributions through proportional dividend calculations. When the SPV receives rental payments or realizes capital gains, administrators trigger dividend distributions that credit token holders based on their current balance.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Record Dividend Distribution
// POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/tokenization/real-estate/dividends

const response = await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/tokenization/real-estate/dividends', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    tokenAddress: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
    totalAmount: "50000", // USDC to distribute
    paymentToken: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48", // USDC
    recordDate: "2025-01-15T00:00:00Z"
  })
});

// Smart contract calculates per-token amount
// Credits holders proportionally to their balances
```

```typescript Add Property Record
// POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/tokenization/real-estate/records

await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/tokenization/real-estate/records', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    tokenAddress: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
    recordType: "maintenance",
    year: 2025,
    description: "HVAC system replacement - $15,000",
    documentURI: "ipfs://Qm.../hvac-invoice.pdf"
  })
});

// Creates immutable maintenance record on-chain
```
</CodeGroup>

The contract maintains complete distribution history, enabling tax reporting and performance analytics. Token holders access their dividend claims through the platform dashboard or by querying the smart contract directly.

## ERC-1400 Compatibility

Real Estate Tokens implement the ERC-1400 standard for partially fungible tokens, enabling advanced security token features while maintaining ERC-20 compatibility for exchange integration.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Transfer with Data">
        `transferWithData` and `transferFromWithData` attach metadata to transfers—useful for recording purchase agreements, accreditation proof, or regulatory compliance documentation.

        ```solidity
        // Transfer with attached compliance data
        token.transferWithData(
            recipientAddress,
            1000e18,
            abi.encode("Accredited Investor", "SEC Reg D exemption")
        );
        ```
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Redemption">
        Token holders can burn tokens through `redeem` to exit their investment, triggering buyback procedures defined in the SPV agreement. The contract emits redemption events that initiate off-chain settlement processes.

        ```solidity
        // User requests redemption of shares
        token.redeem(
            500e18,
            abi.encode("Redemption request", "Bank account: IBAN...")
        );
        // SPV processes buyback and distributes proceeds
        ```
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Transfer Validation">
        `canTransfer` and `canTransferFrom` enable wallets and exchanges to validate transfers before execution, preventing failed transactions and improving user experience.

        ```typescript
        // Check if transfer will succeed
        const [canTransfer, reason] = await token.canTransfer(
            recipientAddress,
            1000e18,
            "0x"
        );
        
        if (!canTransfer) {
            console.log(`Transfer blocked: ${reason}`);
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Deployment Configuration

Deploy Real Estate Tokens through the Trusset dashboard or factory contract with comprehensive configuration for compliance controls and property metadata.

<Accordion title="Factory Parameters">
When calling `createRealEstateToken` on the factory:

**Token Configuration:**
- `name` / `symbol`: Token identification
- `initialSupply`: Tokens minted to recipient at deployment
- `maxSupply`: Hard cap on total shares (matches SPV equity structure)
- `decimals`: Precision for fractional ownership (typically 18)

**Compliance Controls:**
- `maxPerWallet`: Maximum tokens per address (0 = unlimited)
- `whitelistEnabled`: Require pre-approved addresses for transfers
- `blacklistEnabled`: Block specific addresses from participation
- `freezeEnabled`: Allow temporary account suspension
- `kycRequired`: Enforce identity verification via registry

**Property Data:**
- `propertyAddress`: Physical location of real estate
- `documentUri`: Link to legal documents, deeds, valuations
- `identityRegistry`: KYC verification contract address
- `admin`: Address with full administrative control
- `recipient`: Initial token recipient (typically SPV or issuer)

The factory tracks all deployed tokens by creator, enabling portfolio management across multiple properties.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Real Estate Tokens represent securities in most jurisdictions. Issuers must ensure compliance with local securities laws, obtain necessary licenses, and provide appropriate investor disclosures before deployment.
</Warning>

## Operational Features

Administrators manage property operations through privileged functions that maintain property records and handle compliance actions:

- **Force Transfers**: Execute transfers on behalf of users for court orders or regulatory compliance
- **Account Freezing**: Temporarily lock accounts during disputes or investigations
- **Document Updates**: Modify `documentUri` as new valuations, audits, or legal documents become available
- **Record Management**: Add sales history, maintenance logs, and ownership changes to on-chain records
- **Minting/Burning**: Issue new shares for capital raises or burn shares for buybacks

All administrative actions emit events that create complete audit trails for regulatory reporting and investor transparency.
