Claim Rights tokenize verifiable entitlements without requiring transferability or fungibility. Issue non-transferable credentials, membership access, subscription rights, or conditional entitlements that execute when specific on-chain conditions are met.

## Why Institutions Issue Claim Rights

## Claim Types

Claim Rights support ten distinct entitlement categories that map to common institutional requirements:

| Claim Type | Use Case | Transferable |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `ACCESS` | Building entry, system login, gated content | No |
| `MEMBERSHIP` | Club membership, loyalty programs, association rights | Optional |
| `ENTITLEMENT` | Benefits, perks, usage quotas | No |
| `LICENSE` | Software licenses, IP rights, operating permits | Restricted |
| `SUBSCRIPTION` | Service access, recurring entitlements | No |
| `REWARD` | Loyalty points, achievement badges, incentives | Optional |
| `VOUCHER` | Discount codes, gift certificates, promotional claims | Yes |
| `TICKET` | Event admission, seat reservations, access passes | Yes |
| `CERTIFICATE` | Credentials, certifications, proof of completion | No |
| `CUSTOM` | Institution-defined claim types with custom logic | Configurable |

Each claim type inherits default behavior that issuers can override through rule modules. For example, `TICKET` claims enable transfer by default to support secondary markets, while `LICENSE` claims restrict transfers to approved parties only.

## Rule Module System

Rule modules execute custom validation logic before claim execution. Attach multiple modules that check balance requirements, time windows, identity verification, or external oracle data.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Balance Requirement
// Claim requires minimum token balance
const balanceModule = {
    moduleType: 'BALANCE_GATE',
    tokenAddress: '0x...', // Required token
    minBalance: '1000000000000000000', // 1 token
    checkOnExecution: true
};
```

```typescript Time Window
// Claim only valid during specific period
const timeModule = {
    moduleType: 'TIME_LOCK',
    startTime: 1735689600, // Jan 1, 2025
    endTime: 1767225600,   // Jan 1, 2026
    requireActiveWindow: true
};
```

```typescript Identity Verification
// Claim requires KYC completion
const kycModule = {
    moduleType: 'IDENTITY_GATE',
    registryAddress: '0x...',
    requiredLevel: 2, // Enhanced verification
    checkExpiry: true
};
```

```typescript Custom Logic
// Claim validates against external contract
const customModule = {
    moduleType: 'CUSTOM',
    validatorContract: '0x...',
    callData: '0x...', // Encoded validation params
    revertOnFalse: true
};
```
</CodeGroup>

When a user attempts to execute a claim, the contract iterates through all attached modules in sequence. If any module returns `false`, the entire transaction reverts. This enables complex conditional logic like "claim requires both KYC verification AND minimum balance AND execution during business hours."

### Modules

| Module | Address | Network |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `TimeModule` | `0x62A1D34069E8ed7451B7B4BD36454d237561D8f4` | Sepolia |
| `UsageModule` | `0xD1806A8FBB2B8d7Eb947928df9231787387075Fe` | Sepolia |
| `ConditionalAcccessModule` | `0x92797faA1C89740AC8309590F846F7007C301b91` | Sepolia |
| `TransferabilityModule` | `0xDd1d1Dc1dFA6C8F216cA6377b8949f8EbE43ce37` | Sepolia |

## Execution Flow

Claims follow a two-step execution pattern that separates entitlement assignment from fulfillment:

```typescript
// Step 1: Issuer creates claim right
await claimRightFactory.createClaimRight({
    name: "Premium Membership 2025",
    symbol: "MEMBER25",
    claimType: "MEMBERSHIP",
    metadataURI: "ipfs://Qm..." // Benefits description
});

// Step 2: User receives claim NFT
await claimRight.mint(userAddress);

// Step 3: User executes claim to access benefits
const success = await claimRight.executeClaim(
    tokenId,
    executionProof // Optional signature or merkle proof
);
// Contract validates all rule modules
// External system reads on-chain execution event
// Benefits activated in backend systems
```

<Accordion title="Execution vs Transfer">
**Execution** means using the claim for its intended purpose (accessing a service, redeeming a benefit). The NFT remains in the user's wallet after execution unless the claim type specifies burn-on-use behavior.

**Transfer** means moving the claim NFT to another address. Most claim types disable transfers to prevent unauthorized access. Enable transfers only for vouchers, tickets, or reward points that benefit from secondary markets.
</Accordion>

## Metadata Standards

Claim Right metadata extends ERC-721 standards with additional fields for entitlement details:

```json
{
    "name": "Premium Membership 2025",
    "description": "Annual premium access with conference tickets",
    "image": "ipfs://Qm.../membership-badge.png",
    "attributes": [
        {
            "trait_type": "Claim Type",
            "value": "MEMBERSHIP"
        },
        {
            "trait_type": "Valid Until",
            "value": "2025-12-31"
        },
        {
            "trait_type": "Execution Count",
            "value": "0/1" // Single-use claim
        }
    ],
    "entitlements": [
        "Conference access (3 days)",
        "Private lounge access",
        "Priority support channel",
        "10% merchandise discount"
    ],
    "executionRules": [
        {
            "type": "TIME_LOCK",
            "startDate": "2025-01-01",
            "endDate": "2025-12-31"
        },
        {
            "type": "IDENTITY_GATE",
            "kycRequired": true,
            "minVerificationLevel": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

Frontend applications parse this metadata to display claim details, validate execution requirements, and guide users through fulfillment processes.

## Deployment Configuration

Deploy Claim Rights through the Trusset dashboard or directly via the factory contract:

<Accordion title="Factory Parameters">
```typescript
interface ClaimRightConfig {
    name: string;              // Display name
    symbol: string;            // Ticker symbol
    claimType: ClaimType;      // Predefined or CUSTOM
    metadataURI: string;       // IPFS or HTTPS link
    transferable: boolean;     // Enable secondary markets
    burnsOnExecution: boolean; // Destroy after first use
    maxSupply: uint256;        // Cap on total claims (0 = unlimited)
    kycRequired: boolean;      // Require identity verification
    pausable: boolean;         // Emergency stop capability
}
```

All Claim Right contracts deploy as UUPS upgradeable proxies, enabling issuers to add new rule modules or fix bugs without redeploying. Users retain their claim NFTs through upgrades.
</Accordion>

## Use Cases

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Event Ticketing">
        Issue non-transferable tickets as Claim Rights with time-locked execution. Users prove ownership to enter events without requiring centralized ticket validation systems.

        ```typescript
        // Create event ticket claim
        const ticket = await factory.createClaimRight({
            name: "Tech Summit 2025 - VIP Pass",
            symbol: "SUMMIT-VIP",
            claimType: "TICKET",
            transferable: true, // Enable resale
            burnsOnExecution: false // Keep as proof of attendance
        });
        
        // Add time lock rule
        await ticket.addRuleModule({
            moduleType: "TIME_LOCK",
            startTime: eventStartTimestamp,
            endTime: eventEndTimestamp
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Software Licensing">
        Issue revocable software licenses that validate against on-chain subscription status. Revoke access instantly when subscriptions expire without modifying client software.

        ```typescript
        // License claim with subscription check
        const license = await factory.createClaimRight({
            name: "Enterprise License - Annual",
            symbol: "ENT-LIC",
            claimType: "LICENSE",
            transferable: false,
            burnsOnExecution: false
        });
        
        // Require active subscription balance
        await license.addRuleModule({
            moduleType: "BALANCE_GATE",
            tokenAddress: subscriptionTokenAddress,
            minBalance: "1000000000000000000" // 1 active subscription
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Access Control">
        Replace traditional access cards with Claim Rights that validate against multiple conditions. Update access rules without reissuing credentials.

        ```typescript
        // Building access claim
        const access = await factory.createClaimRight({
            name: "HQ Building Access",
            symbol: "HQ-ACCESS",
            claimType: "ACCESS",
            transferable: false,
            burnsOnExecution: false
        });
        
        // Require KYC and business hours
        await access.addRuleModule({
            moduleType: "IDENTITY_GATE",
            registryAddress: kycRegistry,
            requiredLevel: 1
        });
        
        await access.addRuleModule({
            moduleType: "TIME_LOCK",
            startTime: businessHoursStart,
            endTime: businessHoursEnd,
            dailyRepeat: true
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Claim Rights are experimental and have not undergone formal security audits. Use in production environments at your own risk. Thoroughly test rule module logic before deploying with real user entitlements.
