Stock Tokens eliminate third-party dependencies and settlement delays by bringing equity trading on-chain. Lock existing stocks, issue tokens backed by verifiable reserves, and enable instant settlement with round-the-clock markets.

## How It Works

Users lock their existing stock certificates with the issuer and receive an equivalent amount of Stock Tokens. The issuer maintains a Lock Reference URI pointing to third-party attestations, audit reports, or reserve documentation—whatever proof matches their compliance requirements.

Stock Tokens follow standard ERC-20 mechanics while representing unique ownership certificates that satisfy regulatory frameworks. Each token carries the same transfer rules as traditional equity but settles instantly on-chain.

<Accordion title="Automated Corporate Actions">
The platform handles corporate actions without manual intervention:

- **Dividends**: Smart contracts calculate per-token amounts and credit holders proportionally
- **Stock Splits**: Token supplies and balances adjust atomically on-chain
- **Trading Halts**: Transfers freeze when compliance requires it
- **Rights Issues**: New token allocations distribute to existing holders automatically

All operations execute through on-chain logic with complete audit trails.

## Sub-Issuer Architecture

Multiple institutions can issue tokens against the same underlying stock without fragmenting liquidity. When a new financial institution wants to offer the same equity token, they operate as a sub-issuer under the original deployment.

| Traditional Approach | Sub-Issuer Model |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Each institution deploys separate contract | All institutions share one token contract |
| Liquidity fragments across deployments | Unified liquidity pool across all issuers |
| New prospectus required per institution | Reference existing prospectus |
| Limited order book depth | Deep liquidity from combined user base |

All sub-issuers mint tokens from the same contract, creating a unified liquidity pool. Users trading through Institution A can instantly match with users from Institution B because they're exchanging the same token. Each sub-issuer manages their own lock references and redemption processes independently, but the tokens themselves remain fungible across the entire network.

## Issuance Example

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Dashboard Deployment
// Navigate to Trusset Dashboard > Issue Token > Stock Token
// Configure parameters:

const stockConfig = {
  underlyingStock: "AAPL",
  lockReferenceURI: "ipfs://Qm.../audit-2025-Q1.pdf",
  identityRegistry: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
  corporateActions: {
    dividends: true,
    stockSplits: true,
    tradingHalts: true
  }
};

// Dashboard generates deployment transaction
// Token contract deploys automatically
```

```typescript API Deployment
// POST https://api.trusset.org/v1/tokenization/stocks/deploy

const response = await fetch('https://api.trusset.org/v1/tokenization/stocks/deploy', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    symbol: "tAAPL",
    name: "Tokenized Apple Inc.",
    underlyingStock: "AAPL",
    lockReferenceURI: "ipfs://Qm.../audit-2025-Q1.pdf",
    identityRegistry: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
    enableCorporateActions: true
  })
});

const stockToken = await response.json();
console.log(`Deployed at: ${stockToken.address}`);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Compliance Integration

Stock Tokens connect to identity registries that validate KYC status and investor accreditation before allowing transfers. The contracts check verification status on-chain during every transfer, blocking transactions to non-compliant addresses automatically.

<Warning>
Issuers must maintain valid Lock Reference URIs and ensure reserve attestations stay current. Failure to update documentation can impact regulatory compliance and user trust.
</Warning>

The smart contracts maintain complete audit trails. Every mint, burn, transfer, and corporate action generates events that compliance systems can monitor in real-time. These logs prove the chain of custody and timing of all operations without relying on self-reported data.
