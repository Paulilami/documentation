Trusset infrastructure supports full MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) and eWpG (German Electronic Securities Act) compliance through technical implementation. We provide the technology enabling regulatory adherence—issuers manage their legal frameworks, prospectuses, and regulatory filings independently.

## Supported Frameworks

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="MiCA Compliance" icon="landmark">
    EU Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation for asset-referenced tokens, e-money tokens, and utility tokens with comprehensive disclosure requirements
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="eWpG Compliance" icon="file-certificate">
    German Electronic Securities Act enabling legally binding digital securities replacing physical certificates with blockchain records
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## MiCA Integration

MiCA requires issuers to publish whitepapers, maintain reserve assets, and implement robust governance. Our infrastructure provides technical capabilities supporting these requirements through on-chain document references linking whitepapers and disclosure documents, identity verification systems enforcing investor classification and jurisdiction restrictions, reserve tracking mechanisms for asset-referenced tokens, and governance controls through IVC-based administration without single admin keys.

Issuers remain responsible for whitepaper content, reserve management, regulatory registration, and compliance monitoring. Trusset infrastructure enables technical implementation of regulatory requirements but does not provide legal or compliance advice.

## eWpG Implementation

The eWpG framework allows German securities to exist solely in electronic form without physical certificates. Our Light Tokens implement eWpG requirements through ERC-1400 compliance with partition-based accounting, on-chain document management storing prospectuses and legal references, identity registry integration for investor verification, and transfer restriction enforcement based on securities law requirements.

German financial institutions issue eWpG-compliant securities directly on blockchain satisfying legal requirements for dematerialized securities. The token contract serves as the authoritative record of ownership recognized under German law when properly registered and documented.

## On-Chain Document Management

Token contracts include document management systems for attaching legal references, regulatory filings, and compliance documentation directly on-chain. Issuers set document references through IVC-executed operations linking IPFS URIs or external storage with content hashes for verification.

<Accordion title="Document Types and References">
**MiCA Whitepapers**: Complete disclosure documents required for public token offerings, updated versions timestamped on-chain for regulatory audit trails

**eWpG Prospectuses**: Securities offering documents required under German law, stored with cryptographic hashes proving authenticity and version control

**Terms and Conditions**: Legal agreements governing token holder rights, redemption procedures, and issuer obligations

**Compliance Reports**: Periodic disclosures for regulatory authorities including reserve attestations, audit reports, and financial statements

**Corporate Actions**: Documentation of dividends, splits, mergers, or other events affecting token holder rights
</Accordion>

Documents can be public or private depending on regulatory requirements and issuer preferences. Public documents use IPFS or similar decentralized storage with on-chain URI references. Private documents store encrypted with access controls limiting visibility to authorized parties while maintaining on-chain hash verification.

## Trusset Certifications

Our infrastructure meets institutional security and compliance standards required for regulated financial services.

| Certification | Scope |
|--------------|-------|
| DORA Certified | Digital Operational Resilience Act compliance for EU financial entities |
| ISO Compliant | Information security management systems following international standards |
| Audited Backend | Third-party security audits of API infrastructure and data handling |
| Audited Contracts | Smart contract security reviews by specialized blockchain auditors |

These certifications validate our technical infrastructure security and operational resilience. Issuers leverage certified infrastructure while managing their own regulatory compliance, licensing, and legal obligations.

<Note>
Trusset provides technology infrastructure supporting regulatory compliance. Issuers remain responsible for obtaining necessary licenses, filing regulatory documents, and ensuring legal compliance in their jurisdictions.
</Note>

## Issuer Responsibilities

Financial institutions using Trusset infrastructure must manage their regulatory obligations including obtaining required licenses for securities issuance or crypto-asset services, preparing and filing whitepapers, prospectuses, or offering documents, maintaining reserve assets or capital requirements, implementing compliance monitoring and reporting systems, and ensuring investor protection and disclosure obligations.

Trusset infrastructure provides technical capabilities enabling these obligations but does not substitute for legal counsel, regulatory advice, or compliance services. Consult qualified legal and regulatory advisors before issuing tokens or operating digital asset services.

## Document Updates and Versioning

Update legal documents through IVC-executed operations maintaining complete version history on-chain. Each update records timestamp, content hash, and document URI enabling regulatory auditors to verify document authenticity and track changes over time.

Set document expiration dates requiring periodic renewal for time-sensitive filings. Configure automatic notifications when documents approach expiration ensuring timely updates before regulatory deadlines. All document operations emit events for monitoring and compliance tracking.

## Jurisdiction-Specific Rules

Implement transfer restrictions based on jurisdiction stored in identity proofs. Configure rules preventing transfers to restricted countries, requiring enhanced verification for specific jurisdictions, enforcing holding periods by investor location, or limiting token availability to accredited investors in certain regions.

The identity registry stores country codes as cryptographic hashes maintaining privacy while enabling enforcement. Smart contracts check jurisdiction during transfers without exposing personal data ensuring both compliance and user privacy.

<Warning>
Regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction and asset type. Ensure your token configuration, document references, and transfer restrictions align with applicable laws in your operating regions.
