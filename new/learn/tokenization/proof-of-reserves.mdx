description: "Reserve transparency for tokenized assets"

Trusset provides infrastructure for issuers to demonstrate that their assets exist and are properly backed.

## How It Works

Each tokenized asset includes a **Reserve URI** — a link to a webpage, API endpoint, or document where the issuer publishes reserve information. Anyone can access this link and review the underlying data.

This creates a transparent, auditable record of reserve claims directly tied to on-chain assets.

## Community Signals (Optional)

As an additional transparency layer, users can submit **votes** on Reserve URIs:

- **True**: The reserve information appears legitimate and verifiable.
- **False**: The link is broken, outdated, or contains unsubstantiated claims.

If an asset accumulates significant negative votes, it can be flagged as higher risk. This provides a lightweight, community-driven signal — not a guarantee of accuracy, but a public record of sentiment.

> Voting is designed to catch obvious issues, not replace proper audits or regulatory oversight.

## The Honest Reality

No on-chain mechanism — including ours or Chainlink's Proof of Reserve — can cryptographically prove that physical assets exist. Both systems verify *data*, not *reality*.

The actual trust model for tokenized real-world assets relies on:

- **Regulated custodians** with legal liability
- **Licensed issuers** operating under frameworks like MiCA or MiFID
- **Independent audits** and ongoing compliance requirements

Our infrastructure provides transparency and auditability. The trust anchor remains the legal and regulatory framework your issuer operates under.

## When to Use What

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Trusset Reserve URIs** | Any asset, any format, low cost, universal |
| **Chainlink PoR** | Assets with oracle-compatible custodians and API access |
| **Traditional audits** | Regulatory compliance, institutional credibility |

These approaches complement each other. Most real-world assets today cannot integrate with oracle-based PoR because banks and custodians don't expose the required APIs.
