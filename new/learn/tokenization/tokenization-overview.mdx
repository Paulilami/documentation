Our tokenization framework provides smart contracts designed for institutional asset tokenization with built-in compliance and governance. Choose between Light Tokens for straightforward asset representation or deploy specialized Fat Token contracts for assets requiring on-chain management workflows.

## Token Models

Light Tokens are ERC-1400 (also integrates with ERC-3643) compliant security tokens designed for representing existing real-world assets with established legal frameworks. These streamlined tokens focus on ownership representation with integrated compliance features including KYC verification, account freezing, partition-based accounting, and document management. Light Tokens work best for existing equity shares with established shareholder agreements, bonds with existing indentures, commodities with external storage systems, or any asset where detailed information exists off-chain.

Fat Tokens bring complete asset management on-chain with asset-specific implementations. Each asset type has its own contract set with specialized functionality, variables, and compliance mechanisms tailored to that asset class. These tokens enable automated workflows, specialized data structures, and native DeFi integration. Fat Tokens work best for creating new financial products entirely on-chain, automating complex asset management workflows, or assets requiring specialized operations and composability.

## Contract Infrastructure

The tokenization framework operates through interconnected infrastructure contracts deployed on Ethereum mainnet and compatible networks.

Deploy tokens through the factory with your specified parameters, configure compliance features and metadata, mint initial supply to designated addresses, and integrate with supporting infrastructure like oracles and adapters. All operations route through Instance Vault Contracts for governance without admin keys.

## Compliance Framework

Transfer controls integrate automatically with your tokens. KYC integration performs identity verification checks before transfers, account freezing suspends specific addresses for regulatory response, and partition-based restrictions enable granular control over different token tranches. All compliance operations execute through your Instance Vault Contract with full audit trail.

## Integration Options

Deploy and manage tokens through direct contract interaction using Web3 libraries, our REST API for institutional-grade operations through the issuer platform, or configure automated value updates through oracle endpoints. All deployment methods provide the same security guarantees and governance structure.
