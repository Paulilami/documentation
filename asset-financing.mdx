title: "Asset Financing"
description: "Peer-to-peer financing for tokenized asset purchases"
---

Asset financing enables buyers to purchase tokens with partial down payments. Sellers act as lenders, receiving monthly payments with interest.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Down Payment">
    Buyer pays 25-80% of asset value. Lower down payments result in higher interest rates.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Escrow Lock">
    Tokens held in smart contract escrow. Released to buyer upon full payment completion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monthly Payments">
    Automated monthly payments to seller. Interest calculated based on down payment and duration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Completion">
    Final payment triggers automatic token transfer from escrow to buyer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Interest Rates

Algorithmically calculated based on down payment percentage:

| Down Payment | Typical Rate | Max Duration |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 25-40% | 12-15% APR | 5 years |
| 40-60% | 8-12% APR | 10 years |
| 60-80% | 4-8% APR | 30 years |

## Technical Implementation

```solidity
struct Mortgage {
    address borrower;
    address lender;
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    uint256 totalLoanAmount;
    uint256 monthlyPayment;
    uint256 remainingAmount;
    MortgageStatus status;
}
```

**The MortgageManager contract handles:**

- Payment processing and tracking
- Interest rate calculation
- Default detection and penalties
- Escrow release conditions

## Configuration
Enable financing when creating listings:

```json
{
  "enableMortgage": true,
  "mortgageTerms": {
    "maxDuration": 31536000,  // 1 year in seconds
    "minDownPayment": 2500,    // 25% in basis points
    "qualityBorrowers": true,  // Require good credit
    "paymentToken": "0x..."    // USDC or ETH
  }
}
```

<Note>
Financing terms are set per listing. Sellers control minimum down payment, maximum duration, and borrower requirements.
