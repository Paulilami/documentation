description: "Decentralized peer-to-peer financing for tokenized asset purchases with no intermediaries"
---

The first decentralized financing system for tokenized assets. Purchase any tokenized asset with a down payment and structured payment plan, connecting borrowers directly to asset sellers without banks or financial institutions.

## The Problem

Traditional asset financing requires banks, credit checks, lengthy approval processes, high fees, and geographic restrictions. Most assets cannot be financed at all. Buyers need full payment upfront or must navigate complex lending systems with middlemen taking profits.

## The Solution

Direct peer-to-peer asset financing through smart contracts. Asset sellers become lenders, receiving immediate down payments and monthly payments with competitive returns. Buyers access financing for any tokenized asset with fair rates and no ongoing fees.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Asset">
    Choose any tokenized asset with financing enabled. Set your preferred down payment percentage and loan duration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make Down Payment">
    Pay the required down payment (5-80% of asset value). Tokens are held in escrow until loan completion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monthly Payments">
    Make monthly payments directly to the asset seller. Interest rates calculated algorithmically based on down payment and duration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Asset Transfer">
    Upon final payment, tokens transfer automatically from escrow to your wallet. No manual processes or intermediaries.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

### For Buyers

The system enables asset purchases with partial down payments. Tokens are held in escrow during the financing period, transferring to the buyer upon completion.

<Accordion title="Down Payment Options">
  Choose down payment between 5-80% of asset value. Higher down payments result in lower interest rates and better loan terms.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Flexible Terms">
  Loan durations up to 30 years. Monthly payments calculated automatically based on total loan amount plus interest.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Credit Building">
  Successful loan completion improves your credit score for better rates on future financing. Default results in credit penalties.
</Accordion>

### For Sellers/Lenders

Asset sellers receive immediate down payments and monthly income streams with competitive returns on their assets.

<Accordion title="Immediate Liquidity">
  Receive substantial down payment immediately while retaining asset ownership until loan completion.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Predictable Returns">
  Monthly payment schedule provides predictable income stream with interest rates typically higher than traditional investments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Default Protection">
  Automatic default handling returns the asset to the seller while keeping 25% of the payments already received. In every case, the seller earns a compensation fee of min. 2,5% taken from the required down payment.
</Accordion>

## Interest Rate Calculation

Rates are calculated algorithmically based on objective factors:

| Down Payment | Duration | Typical Rate Range |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| 5-25% | 1-5 years | 12-15% |
| 25-50% | 1-10 years | 8-12% |
| 50-80% | 1-30 years | 4-8% |

<Info>
Actual rates vary based on exact down payment percentage and loan duration. The system rewards higher down payments with significantly lower rates.
</Info>

## Default Protection

The system protects both parties through automated escrow and penalty mechanisms:

### For Lenders
- Tokens remain in escrow until loan completion
- Default returns tokens to original seller
- Seller keeps 25% of all payments made plus default penalty (compensation fee)
- No legal proceedings or collection processes needed

### For Borrowers
- Clear payment schedules with no hidden fees
- Grace periods for late payments
- Credit score improvements for on-time payments
- Partial refunds on defaults based on payments made

## Requirements

### To Finance a Purchase
- **Identity Verification**: Complete KYC process for compliance
- **Down Payment**: 5-80% of asset value in accepted payment tokens
- **Credit Standing**: Good credit score preferred for better rates

### To Enable Financing on Listings
- **Asset Verification**: Asset must be properly tokenized and verified
- **Terms Configuration**: Set down payment requirements and maximum loan duration
- **Quality Restrictions**: Optional restriction to borrowers with good credit only

<Warning>
This is a peer-to-peer lending system. Sellers assume credit risk in exchange for competitive returns. Buyers should ensure they can meet payment obligations before committing.
</Warning>
