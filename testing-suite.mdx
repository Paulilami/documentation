## Test Everything

The Trusset Testing Suite gives you a complete sandbox environment to validate your tokenization infrastructure before production deployment.

Test all services end-to-end on testnet networks. No real assets involved. No blockchain costs. Full functionality.

## What You Can Test

## Testing Perspectives

Test from multiple viewpoints to validate complete workflows:

- **User Perspective:** Experience your platform as customers will—investing, trading, borrowing, transferring assets
- **Administrator View:** Test compliance actions, parameter updates, corporate actions, and emergency controls
- **Operator Dashboard:** Monitor all activities, configure webhooks, and validate reporting systems

## Integration Testing

The suite supports custom data integrations:

- Map fields from your existing customer database
- Test synchronization with your KYC provider
- Validate price feed connections
- Configure webhook endpoints for real-time notifications

All testing happens on testnet with mock data. Your production systems remain untouched.

## What Gets Tested

**Tokenization Workflows:**
- Token issuance with compliance rules
- KYC verification and transfer restrictions
- Corporate actions and profit distributions
- Redemption and burn mechanisms

**Trading Infrastructure:**
- Marketplace deployment and configuration
- Order matching and settlement
- Price discovery mechanisms
- Liquidity pool operations

**Lending Systems:**
- Collateral deposit and valuation
- Loan origination and disbursement
- Interest accrual and payment
- Liquidation triggers and execution

**Compliance Controls:**
- Account freezing and unfreezing
- Transfer restriction enforcement
- Investor eligibility verification
- Regulatory reporting outputs

**Backend Integration:**
- Data synchronization accuracy
- Webhook delivery and retry logic
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance under load

## Move to Production

Once testing validates your implementation:

1. **Switch Networks:** Change from testnet to mainnet with one configuration update
2. **Deploy Contracts:** Your tested contracts deploy to production environment
3. **Go Live:** Start processing real transactions with proven workflows

No code changes required between testing and production. The same APIs, same logic, same infrastructure.

<Info>
The testing environment operates entirely on testnet networks. No real funds, no blockchain costs, no risk to production systems.
