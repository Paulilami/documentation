Verification passes enable compliant token creation through licensed issuers. These passes contain pre-approved parameters that ensure regulatory compliance from the start.

## What are Verification Passes

Verification passes (vPasses) are encrypted certificates containing approved token parameters. Licensed issuers create these passes after completing legal and regulatory review of your asset.

## Issuer Network

Any licensed financial institution can join the issuer network. Users are matched with appropriate issuers based on location and regulatory requirements.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Issuer Matching">
    System recommends the nearest issuer that can fulfill your specific asset type and jurisdictional requirements.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Free Choice">
    Users can select any licensed issuer from the network, not just the recommended one.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Global Coverage">
    Access to licensed issuers worldwide for different asset types and regulatory frameworks.

  <Step title="Direct Connection">
    Work directly with your chosen issuer through their dashboard or API integration.

## How Verification Passes Work

The system connects asset owners with licensed issuers through secure verification passes stored both on-chain and off-chain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Asset Review">
    Licensed issuer reviews your asset documentation and determines appropriate token parameters for regulatory compliance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pass Creation">
    Issuer creates verification pass containing approved token settings. Pass is stored on-chain and encrypted data stored off-chain.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Delivery">
    Verification pass appears in your interface automatically when issued to your wallet address.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="One-Click Creation">
    Select the verification pass and approve to create compliant tokens immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pass Structure

Verification passes contain specific data required for compliant token creation:

<Accordion title="Token Parameters">
  **Basic Settings**: Name, symbol, supply, asset type
  
  **Compliance Rules**: KYC requirements, transfer restrictions, investor eligibility
  
  **Financial Terms**: Fee structures, supply limits, transfer limits
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Locked Fields">
  **Protected Parameters**: Critical compliance settings that cannot be modified by token creator
  
  **Flexible Parameters**: Settings that can be adjusted within approved ranges
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Expiration">
  **Time Limits**: Verification passes expire after set period to ensure current compliance
  
  **Single Use**: Each pass can only be used once to create tokens
</Accordion>

## Technical Implementation

The verification pass system uses both on-chain and off-chain components for security and efficiency.

### On-Chain Storage

```solidity
struct VPass {
    string encryptedData;
    address issuer;
    address receiver;
    uint256 expiresAt;
    bool isUsed;
    uint256 createdAt;
}
```

### Off-Chain Encryption

- Token parameters encrypted using AES-256-CBC
- Encryption keys split between on-chain and off-chain storage
- Only intended recipient can decrypt pass contents

## Issuer Operations

Licensed issuers can manage verification passes through multiple interfaces:

    Web-based interface for creating and managing verification passes for clients.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="API Integration" icon="code">
    Direct API integration for issuers with existing systems and workflows.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Issuer Capabilities

- **Pass Creation**: Generate verification passes for approved assets
- **Pass Management**: View, deactivate, or modify active passes
- **Client Tracking**: Monitor pass usage and token creation
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports for regulatory requirements

## Security Features

The verification pass system includes multiple security layers:

- **Cryptographic Signatures**: All passes signed by issuer private keys
- **Address Verification**: Passes locked to specific recipient addresses
- **Expiration Controls**: Automatic expiration prevents stale approvals
- **Usage Tracking**: Complete audit trail of pass creation and usage
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against spam and abuse
