## Overview

This API enables banks and financial institutions to launch their own institutional-grade stablecoins with complete control over minting, burning, and compliance requirements. Each stablecoin is deployed as an independent smart contract with customizable parameters for regulatory compliance.

The system provides:

1. **Factory Deployment** - Deploy new stablecoins with custom parameters including transfer fees
2. **Supply Management** - Mint and burn tokens with role-based access control and limits
3. **Compliance Integration** - Optional KYC/AML checks through our Identity Registry
4. **Account Management** - Freeze and unfreeze addresses for regulatory compliance
5. **Reserve Transparency** - On-chain and off-chain reserve attestation
6. **Fund Recovery** - Recover funds from frozen accounts for regulatory purposes
7. **Role Management** - Granular permissions for minting, burning, freezing, and recovery operations

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your instance API key.

## Deployment Flow

1. **Deploy Stablecoin** - Create your stablecoin with desired parameters
2. **Grant Roles** - Assign minter/burner/freezer roles to authorized addresses
3. **Set Limits** - Configure monthly minting limits for compliance
4. **Mint Initial Supply** - Create initial token supply to designated addresses
5. **Update Reserves** - Sync reserve data for transparency
6. **Manage Operations** - Mint, burn, freeze, and monitor as needed
