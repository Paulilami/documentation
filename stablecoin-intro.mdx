## Overview

This API enables banks and financial institutions to launch their own institutional-grade stablecoins with complete control over minting, burning, and compliance requirements. Each stablecoin is deployed as an independent smart contract with customizable parameters for regulatory compliance.

2. **Supply Management** - Mint and burn tokens with role-based access control
3. **Compliance Integration** - Optional KYC/AML checks through our Identity Registry
4. **Reserve Transparency** - On-chain and off-chain reserve attestation
5. **Role Management** - Granular permissions for minting and burning operations

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your instance API key.

## Deployment Flow

1. **Deploy Stablecoin** - Create your stablecoin with desired parameters
2. **Grant Roles** - Assign minter/burner roles to authorized addresses
3. **Mint Initial Supply** - Create initial token supply to designated addresses
