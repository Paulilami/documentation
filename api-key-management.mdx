Your API keys are instance-specific, meaning you have multiple API-keys for each instance. API-keys can be revoked, rotated, paused, and deleted. All API calls affect the rate-limit of the associated instance. Users can have u to three API-keys per instance.

## Creation 
Your first API key is automatically generated as `Default: active` with your instance creation. The key interface looks like following:

**Key-format:**
```txt
trusset_v2_c0...
```

## Key-Rotation
Trusset allows you to securely rotate your keys. A new key will be generated immediately, while the old key will remain valid for 7 days to allow a smooth transition (can be customized).

## Key-Revoking
Revoking your key immediately disables this API key and cannot be undone. The API key, and all operations remain in your database.

## Key-Pausing
Keys can be paused for a certain duration, disabling this key until the pause-period is over.

## Key-Deletion
Deleting your keys will delete your database key-records as well and cannot be undone. On-chain related data will **not** be deletd.
