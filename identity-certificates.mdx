## On-Chain Storage

Identity data is stored on-chain as hashed values:
- KYC verification status
- Country jurisdiction
- Issuing institution
- Expiry timestamp

No personal information is stored on-chain. Only verification proofs.

## Compliance Integration

Identity certificates automatically integrate with your tokens:
- Transfers blocked for non-verified addresses
- Automatic expiry enforcement
- Cross-token verification sharing
- Jurisdiction-based restrictions

## Legal Responsibility

<Warning>
Manual verification requires your institution to assume full legal responsibility for the accuracy of submitted KYC data. Ensure proper compliance procedures before enabling manual verification.
</Warning>

<Note>
Identity certificates are required for tokens with KYC flags enabled. Recipients must be verified before receiving tokens.
