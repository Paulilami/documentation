description: "On-chain identity verification system using zero knowledge proofs for compliant asset tokenization"
---

An on-chain identity verification system that stores zero knowledge proofs of verified personal data. Users control their identity completely while enabling automated compliance for security token transactions.

## How Identity Certificates Work

Identity certificates store cryptographic proofs of verified personal data on-chain without revealing the underlying information. Users verify their identity once with licensed issuers and can prove their credentials to any service without sharing personal data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Verification Provider">
    Select from licensed issuers and identity verification providers in the network. Users are not locked to any single provider.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Verification">
    Undergo identity verification process with your chosen provider using their existing systems and compliance procedures.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Cryptographic Proof">
    Provider issues zero knowledge proof to your identity certificate. Only you can see the underlying verified data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use for Compliance">
    Prove your identity to any service without sharing personal information. Automated compliance for security token transactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification Types

The system supports multiple types of identity verification, each contributing to your overall completion score:

<Accordion title="Contact Verification">
  **Email and Phone**: Basic contact verification ensuring you control the provided communication channels. Required for minimum compliance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Identity Documents">
  **Passport, ID Card, Driver's License**: Government-issued identification verification through licensed providers like Onfido.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Personal Information">
  **Full Name and Address**: Verified personal details matching official documentation and residence confirmation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="KYC Compliance">
  **Complete KYC Data**: Full regulatory compliance package including background checks and risk assessment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Financial Information">
  **Proof of Income**: Verified income documentation for qualified investor status and borrowing capacity assessment.
</Accordion>

<Note>
The current demo version supports email verification to demonstrate functionality. Full verification types are being implemented with licensed providers.

## Key Features

### Zero Knowledge Privacy

Users prove they meet requirements without revealing personal information. The system stores only cryptographic proofs, never actual data.

| What's Stored | What's Hidden |
|--------------|---------------|
| Proof that you verified email | Your actual email address |
| Proof of age verification | Your exact age or birthdate |
| Proof of residence | Your specific address |
| Proof of income level | Your exact income amount |

### Multi-Issuer Network

</Columns>

### Automated Compliance

Identity certificates integrate directly with security token compliance rules. Tokens can require specific verification levels automatically.

<Info>
When a security token has the "KYC_VERIFIED" flag enabled, only users with valid KYC proofs in their certificates can receive transfers.
</Info>

## Technical Architecture

### On-Chain Registry

The identity registry smart contract stores verification proofs with the following structure:

- **Proof Hash**: Cryptographic proof of verified data
- **Issuer Address**: Licensed verifier who issued the proof  
- **Timestamp**: When verification was completed
- **Expiry Date**: When verification expires (if applicable)
- **Active Status**: Whether proof is currently valid

### Completion Scoring

Each verification type contributes to an overall completion score:

| Verification Type | Score Weight | Purpose |
|------------------|--------------|---------|
| Email | 20 points | Basic contact verification |
| Phone | 20 points | Secondary contact verification |
| Full Name | 15 points | Identity confirmation |
| Passport/ID | 15 points | Government document verification |
| Address | 15 points | Residence confirmation |
| KYC Data | 15 points | Regulatory compliance |

**Total possible score: 100 points**

### Issuer Authorization

Only authorized issuers can add verification proofs to user certificates. This ensures all verifications come from trusted, licensed providers.

## Privacy Protection

### No Data Storage

Trusset stores no personal information. The company cannot access, view, or share user data. Only cryptographic proofs exist on-chain.

### User-Controlled Access

Users authorize which services can check their verification status. No automatic data sharing occurs without explicit permission.

### Revocation Rights

Users can revoke specific proofs at any time, removing verification status while maintaining privacy over reasons for revocation.

## Compliance Integration

### Automated Enforcement

Security tokens automatically check identity certificates before allowing transfers. No manual compliance reviews required.

### Regulatory Alignment

The system meets requirements for regulated securities while maintaining user privacy and control.

### Cross-Border Compatibility

Identity certificates work globally, enabling compliant asset tokenization across jurisdictions with varying privacy requirements.
