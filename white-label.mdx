---

Deploy a fully branded platform for your tokenization operations directly from the Issuer Platform interface. Each instance can create one white-label deployment with customizable modules and complete control over branding, access, and functionality.

## Platform Management

White-label deployments are created and configured through the Issuer Platform - the central control system for banks and financial institutions. No API integration required for deployment.

The Issuer Platform provides:
- Visual deployment interface with module selection
- Real-time configuration updates without code
- Deployment logs and monitoring
- Access control management through simple interfaces

## Automatic Permission System

The platform operates without login screens or authentication interfaces. All permissions derive from the connected wallet address automatically.

When users connect their wallet, the system:
- Identifies the wallet's role and permissions instantly
- Shows only the interface elements they can access
- Hides unauthorized functions completely from view
- Adapts the UI based on token-specific permissions

For example, a standard token holder connecting their wallet sees transfer and trading options. The same interface shows minting, burning, and compliance controls when an issuer connects. No manual role selection or authentication required - the blockchain determines access rights.

## Available Modules

Select modules during deployment in the Issuer Platform to build your custom configuration:

### Management Module
Complete management interface. Execute minting, burning, transfers, and compliance operations through visual workflows and automated access control management. The module includes batch operations for efficiency - mint to multiple addresses, import shareholder lists via CSV, or execute mass transfers through the interface.

Analytics dashboards track token distribution, transaction volumes, and holder demographics. Export reports directly or configure automated reporting schedules.

### Selling Module
Enable token holders to list and sell their assets on the marketplace. Create fixed-price listings or auction formats with compliance-checked transfers. The module handles escrow, settlement, and automatic KYC verification for all transactions.

Sellers control listing parameters including price, duration, and accepted payment methods. All sales enforce your token's transfer restrictions and regulatory requirements automatically.

### Mortgage Module
Complete mortgage infrastructure for tokenized assets. Enable buyers to purchase tokens with structured financing while sellers earn interest as lenders.

The mortgage dashboard provides separate interfaces for:
- **Borrowers**: Track payments, view schedules, manage positions
- **Lenders**: Monitor loans, track returns, handle defaults
- **Administrators**: Oversee all mortgages, manage defaults, generate reports

Down payments range from 25-80% with algorithmic interest rate calculation. Smart contracts handle payment collection, default management, and automatic token release upon completion.

### Trading Module
Advanced trading infrastructure that adapts to your token types:

<Accordion title="Security Token Trading">
ERC1400 security tokens and Capital Raise tokens trade through the compliance-checked marketplace. Fixed-price listings, auctions, and peer-to-peer transfers with automatic KYC verification and transfer restriction enforcement.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ERC20 Token Trading">
Stock tokens and standard ERC20s connect to Balancer liquidity pools for 24/7 automated trading. Continuous price discovery through automated market makers without order books.
</Accordion>

### Loan Module
Overcollateralized lending using any tokenized asset as collateral. The unified loan engine automatically adapts to Light Tokens, Fat Tokens, Stock Tokens, and standard ERC20s.

## Deployment Process

Deploy your white-label platform through the Issuer Platform interface:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance">
    Select your instance in the Issuer Platform dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Deployment">
    Click "Deploy Frontend" and select modules, theme, and access controls
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Custom Domain">
    Optional: Configure custom domain or use generated subdomain
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch Platform">
    Deploy instantly and receive your platform URL
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your platform deploys at:
- Default: `https://app.trusset.org/{generated-subdomain}`
- Custom: Your specified domain after DNS configuration

## Configuration Management

### Theme Customization

Configure visual appearance through the Issuer Platform's theme editor:

```
Primary Color    → Main brand color
Secondary Color  → Accent elements
Background      → Base color scheme
Font Family     → Typography selection
Border Radius   → UI element styling
Shadow Level    → Depth and elevation
```

The system automatically generates complementary colors, hover states, and ensures accessibility compliance based on your selections.

### Access Control Layers

Manage access through three integrated levels:

**Platform Level**: Set overall access to PUBLIC, WALLET_RESTRICTED, or KYC_REQUIRED through dropdown selection

**Module Level**: Configure which addresses access specific modules using the access management interface

**Token Level**: Compliance rules from your token configuration apply automatically to all operations

### Instance Liquidity Configuration

Control how lending liquidity works across your instances:

<Accordion title="Instance-Specific Pools">
Default configuration. Each instance maintains separate liquidity pools. Tokens from Instance A can only borrow against liquidity provided to Instance A. Provides maximum control and risk isolation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Global Liquidity Pool">
Enable one instance as the global pool. All tokens from any of your instances can borrow from this shared pool. Maximizes capital efficiency while maintaining issuer-level isolation from other organizations.
</Accordion>

## Real-Time Updates

Modify deployments without downtime through the Issuer Platform:

- **Add/Remove Modules**: Toggle modules on or off instantly
- **Update Theme**: Change colors and branding immediately  
- **Manage Access**: Add or remove authorized addresses
- **Configure Features**: Adjust module settings and permissions

Changes propagate immediately to your live platform. No technical knowledge required.

## API Integration Options

While deployment happens through the Issuer Platform interface, you can integrate platform services via API:

### Read Operations
Query deployment configuration, module settings, and access lists programmatically for integration with existing systems.

### Service Integration
- Execute token operations (mint, burn, transfer)
- Create and manage loans programmatically
- Process investments through the capital raise module
- Query analytics and generate reports

API keys from your instance provide authenticated access to all deployment services.

## Multi-Instance Strategy

Organizations managing diverse asset types benefit from instance isolation with unified management:

**Real Estate Instance**: Deploy with marketplace and capital raise modules for property tokenization

**Corporate Bonds Instance**: Management and investor dashboard for debt instruments

**Stock Token Instance**: Trading platform with Balancer pools for equity derivatives

Each instance maintains separate compliance rules, liquidity pools, and user permissions while sharing organizational branding through the Issuer Platform.

<Note>
The Issuer Platform serves as your central control system. Monitor all operations, configure workflows, and manage deployments through a single interface without writing code.
