description: "Complete ecosystem for tokenizing stocks with 24/7 trading and collateralized lending"
---

Our stock tokenization infrastructure transforms traditional equities into blockchain-based tokens, enabling 24/7 trading, instant settlement, and DeFi functionality while maintaining regulatory compliance through MiCA Asset-Referenced Token (ART) framework.

## Complete Stock Ecosystem

### Three Integrated Components

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Stock Tokenization" icon="lock">
    Convert traditional stocks into blockchain tokens through licensed broker integration
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="24/7 Trading" icon="chart-line">
    Decentralized trading via Balancer weighted pools with up to 100x leverage
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Collateralized Lending" icon="coins">
    Borrow against tokenized stock positions with automated liquidation protection
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

### Tokenization Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Position Lock">
    Licensed broker locks customer's stock position in traditional system
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Token Minting">
    Blockchain tokens minted representing the locked stocks (1:1 ratio)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Trading & DeFi">
    Tokens trade 24/7 on-chain with access to lending and leverage
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Redemption">
    Burn tokens to unlock original stock position at broker
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Regulatory Structure

Tokens are issued as MiCA Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs) that track stock prices without conferring ownership rights. This structure:
- Avoids complex MiFID II securities frameworks
- Enables instant deployment (seconds vs weeks)
- Provides price exposure through debt instruments
- Maintains full regulatory compliance
