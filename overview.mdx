# Trusset Infrastructure

We provide APIs that let banks and asset managers tokenize real-world assets. Your institution gets the technical infrastructure—we handle the blockchain complexity. You focus on your clients.

## What We Build

Enterprise APIs for financial institutions to create and manage tokenized assets. Everything from token issuance to automated compliance to integrated lending—accessible through REST endpoints.

## Compliance Suite
Beyond infrastructure, we provide everything needed for regulatory compliance: templates, workflows, documentation generators, and automated tools. We created [mica-whitepapers.com](https://mica-whitepapers.com), one of the first compliant ART whitepaper generators under MiCA regulation—demonstrating our commitment to making compliance straightforward.
