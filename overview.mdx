# Infrastructure You Own

Most institutions want blockchain's benefits but hesitate—because going "on-chain" usually means vendor lock-in, shared contracts, and giving up control.

**Trusset removes that trade-off.**

We give banks and financial institutions the complete tech stack to run on-chain capital markets independently—with your own contracts, governance, and compliance. Without refactoring code. Without dependencies.

## Two Ways to Build

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="White-Label Deployment" icon="palette" href="/white-label">
    Launch a fully branded investor platform in minutes. Tokenization, trading, lending, and compliance—configured and ready. No frontend build required.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="API Integration" icon="code" href="/api-intro">
    Keep your existing systems. Call REST endpoints; we return signed transactions. Your backend stays in control—we handle blockchain execution.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What This Enables

Your customers can now:

- **Trade stocks 24/7** at near-zero cost
- **Borrow against their portfolio** instantly, without selling
- **Transfer tokenized assets** in seconds, like sending a payment
- **Access holdings transparently** with real-time valuations
- **Set custom rules** from recurring payouts to automated collateral management

**You earn the full revenue** from trading and lending operations. Trusset takes a small share. You see every process in real time and stay fully independent.

## Core Infrastructure

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Independent Infrastructure" icon="building-columns">
    Each institution gets isolated, auditable contracts you own. No shared rails, no external control, no vendor upgrades over your head.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Credit-First Architecture" icon="credit-card">
    Launch isolated lending markets that enable instant liquidity for every asset you tokenize. Automate settlement and risk evaluation.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Backend ↔ Blockchain Sync" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Price feeds, corporate actions, freezes, and distributions—automated directly from your backend with full audit history.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="24/7 Operations" icon="clock">
    Issue, trade, settle, and finance continuously—without blockchain developers, wallet ops, or manual approvals.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Built for Compliance

All contracts follow EU and German regulatory standards. KYC/AML requirements update automatically through our synchronization layer. No manual intervention for transfer restrictions.

Beyond infrastructure, we provide templates, workflows, and automated tools. We created [mica-whitepapers.com](https://mica-whitepapers.com)—one of the first compliant ART whitepaper generators under MiCA regulation.

## Why It's Safer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Instance Isolation">
    Each bank operates in its own environment with dedicated API keys and smart contracts. Other clients cannot affect your operations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Client-Controlled Governance">
    You hold the keys, nominate admins, and define rules. Trusset has no custody or access to your contracts.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Synchronized by Design">
    Risk controls, limits, and compliance triggers all originate from your backend, ensuring transparency and regulatory certainty.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Result

With Trusset, banks don't outsource innovation—they own it.

Deploy, automate, and expand on-chain without dependencies or shared rails.
