# Trusset Infrastructure

We provide APIs that let banks and asset managers tokenize real-world assets. Your institution gets the technical infrastructure—we handle the blockchain complexity. You focus on your clients.

## What We Build

Enterprise APIs for financial institutions to create and manage tokenized assets. Everything from token issuance to automated compliance to integrated lending—accessible through REST endpoints.

## Integration Process

1. **Get API Keys**: Create an account, provision instances
2. **Test Integration**: Use Sepolia testnet endpoints
3. **Configure Rules**: Set compliance parameters via API
4. **Deploy Tokens**: Start issuing for your clients

<Note>
Currently live on Sepolia testnet. Mainnet deployment in Q3 2025 after seed funding close.
