# Meet Trusset

Trusset provides modular APIs that enable banks, asset managers, and stock exchanges to offer complete tokenization services to their clients. Our infrastructure handles everything from token issuance to trading to lending—all through one integration.

## Our Mission

We're building the infrastructure that enables financial institutions to unlock trillions in illiquid assets. By providing complete tokenization APIs with native credit solutions, we're helping banks and asset managers enter the digital asset economy seamlessly, with a technology partner that knows their needs.

## What We Do

We provide an enterprise-grade infrastructure for financial institutions to tokenize, trade, and finance any real-world asset. Our modular APIs enable banks and asset managers to deploy complete digital asset solutions—from issuance to trading to lending—all through one integration.

## Our Vision

We want a financial system where every institution can offer digital asset services to their clients—where tokenization is as simple as traditional banking, where credit flows freely against any asset class, and where regulatory compliance is built-in, not bolted on. A world where financial innovation happens at the speed of software.

<Note>
  **Enterprise Ready**: 24/7/365 availability. Instance-based isolation. Automated compliance processing. Native credit solutions for tokenized assets.
</Note>

## Current State

In July 2025, we launched our demo on the Sepolia testnet so financial institutions and users can test our platform and give feedback. We’re raising seed funding now. Once we close the round, we’ll launch on mainnet in about 8 weeks.
