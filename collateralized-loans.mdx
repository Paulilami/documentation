description: "The first solution enabling overcollateralized loans using security tokens as collateral"
---

The first system that solves the $2 trillion problem: making illiquid security tokens useful for borrowing. Transform baskets of ERC1400 security tokens into fungible, DeFi-compatible collateral through our Asset Wrapper System.

## The Problem

Security tokens representing real-world assets are completely useless for borrowing. You own $100,000 worth of tokenized real estate or corporate bonds? You cannot use them as collateral for loans.

Traditional DeFi lending protocols cannot handle ERC1400 security tokens because:

- **Liquidity Crisis**: Cannot easily sell ERC1400 tokens if borrowers default
- **Valuation Complexity**: Each token has different risk profiles and characteristics  
- **Fragmented Markets**: No unified market for security tokens makes liquidation impossible
- **Compliance Overhead**: Transfer restrictions prevent selling tokens to anyone during liquidation

Result: Trillions of dollars in tokenized assets sitting idle, generating no additional utility despite being on-chain.

## The Solution

The Asset Wrapper System transforms illiquid security tokens into highly liquid, fungible assets that work seamlessly with overcollateralized lending.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Security Tokens">
    Deposit multiple ERC1400 security tokens into the Asset Vault. Real estate, bonds, equity, and other assets create a diversified basket. Compliant security tokens created with our tools can be added instantly with a click.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Wrapper Tokens">
    Get Trusset (TRST) tokens - fully fungible ERC20 tokens representing proportional ownership of the entire asset basket.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use as Collateral">
    Use TRST tokens as collateral for overcollateralized loans in any DeFi protocol or our lending system.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Redeem or Trade">
    Trade TRST tokens freely or redeem them for proportional shares of underlying ERC1400 assets at any time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

### Asset Vault Architecture

The system accepts multiple ERC1400 security tokens meeting quality criteria. Diversification through basketing dramatically reduces the liquidity risk of any individual asset.

<Accordion title="Asset Acceptance">
  Whitelist approved ERC1400 tokens with minimum quality and liquidity thresholds. Real-time compliance checking ensures only verified assets enter the vault.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Valuation System">
  Oracle price feeds provide real-time asset valuations and risk assessments. Dynamic weight adjustments maintain basket stability.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compliance Bridge">
  Maintains unbroken legal ownership transfer while enabling fungible trading. Redemption rights preserve regulatory compliance.
</Accordion>

### Wrapper Token Mechanics

Trusset (TRST) tokens are ERC20 tokens backed 1:1 by locked security tokens with direct redemption rights.

| Action | Process | Result |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Deposit** | Lock ERC1400s → Mint TRST | Fungible tokens representing asset ownership |
| **Trade** | Full ERC20 fungibility | No compliance checks on wrapper trading |
| **Redeem** | Burn TRST → Get ERC1400s | Proportional assets with legal rights |
| **Lend** | Use TRST as collateral | Access to DeFi lending markets |

### Multi-Tier Liquidation

The breakthrough innovation: multiple layers of liquidity protection that solve the core liquidation problem.

## Key Advantages

### Capital Efficiency

- **Lower Collateralization**: Significantly lower ratios than traditional RWA lending due to superior liquidity architecture
- **Productive Assets**: Previously idle security tokens become active DeFi collateral
- **Cross-Asset Liquidity**: Real estate tokens provide liquidity for bond token borrowers

### Technical Innovation

- **True Fungibility**: Creates DeFi compatibility while maintaining regulatory compliance
- **Legal Chain Preservation**: Unbroken ownership transfer for legal requirements
- **Automated Liquidation**: Smart contract enforcement with multiple fallback layers

### Market Impact

<Warning>
This system unlocks massive capital efficiency comparable to when ETH became usable as collateral - expanding the entire DeFi market.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

### For Asset Holders
- Access liquidity without selling underlying assets
- Generate borrowing power from tokenized real estate, bonds, or equity
- Participate in DeFi while maintaining asset exposure

### For DeFi Protocols
- Trillions in new collateral assets become available
- Deeper liquidity pools and more stable lending markets
- Bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance

### For Institutions
- Put tokenized assets to work immediately after tokenization
- Lower borrowing costs through efficient liquidation mechanisms
- Regulatory compliant DeFi participation

## Technical Features

- **Asset Vault**: Securely holds deposited security tokens with compliance validation
- **Wrapper Token**: ERC20 representation with full DeFi compatibility
- **Price Oracle**: Real-time valuations and risk assessments  
- **Lending Protocol**: Overcollateralized borrowing with automatic liquidation
- **Redemption Engine**: Direct conversion to underlying assets with legal compliance
- **Governance System**: Community control over asset inclusion and parameters

## Revolutionary Impact

This system creates a positive feedback loop that grows the entire ecosystem:

1. **More Liquid Collateral** → Lower borrowing costs
2. **Lower Costs** → More adoption  
3. **More Adoption** → Better liquidity
4. **Better Liquidity** → Even lower costs

The compounding effects unlock the $10 trillion RWA market by making tokenized assets actually useful instead of just digital certificates.
