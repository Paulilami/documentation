Access instant liquidity without selling your tokenized assets. Our unified loan engine automatically adapts to different token types - Light Tokens, Fat Tokens, Stock Tokens, and standard ERC20s - providing consistent lending through a single integration.

## Unified Loan Architecture

The loan system combines three solutions into one adaptable interface. Deploy once, support all asset types.

### Adaptive Engine Selection

The system automatically detects token type and routes to the appropriate engine:

| Token Type | Engine | Collateral Features |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Light Tokens (ERC1400)** | Light Engine | Compliance-checked transfers, force recovery support |
| **Fat Tokens** | Fat Engine | Asset-specific parameters, specialized liquidation |
| **Stock Tokens** | Stock Engine | Trading price oracles, automatic price feeds |
| **ERC20 Tokens** | Base Engine | Standard collateral with manual oracle updates |

Each engine handles the specific requirements of its token type while presenting a unified interface for borrowers and lenders.

## Instance-Based Liquidity

Liquidity operates at the instance level, providing issuers complete control over their lending markets.

### Instance Isolation

Each instance maintains separate liquidity pools. Banks create multiple instances for different operations:

- **Instance A**: Premium clients with favorable rates
- **Instance B**: Standard retail lending terms
- **Instance C**: High-risk assets with strict parameters

Tokens from one instance cannot access liquidity from another, maintaining risk boundaries and operational control.

### Global Liquidity Option

Enable one instance as a global pool to maximize capital efficiency:

```
Instance Configuration:
├── Standard Instance 1: Isolated pool for real estate tokens
├── Standard Instance 2: Isolated pool for corporate bonds
└── Global Instance: Shared liquidity for all issuer's tokens
```

When global liquidity is enabled, borrowers from any of your instances access the shared pool while maintaining issuer-level isolation from other organizations.

## Value Registry Integration

The Value Register serves as the central pricing mechanism for all collateralized loans. Every asset must be registered with current valuation data.

### Oracle Types

Configure oracles during token issuance or update them later:

<Accordion title="Synchronization Oracle">
Automatically fetches data from defined endpoints when requested by the value register. Configure custom mapping to translate external data formats into the standard value structure. Updates occur on-demand when loans require current pricing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Manual Oracle">
Requires issuer verification for each value update. Provides maximum control over pricing data with audit trails for every change. Suitable for illiquid assets or those requiring expert valuation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stock Token Oracle">
Built-in oracle for stock tokens using trading prices. Automatically feeds from actual market prices and trading volumes. No manual configuration required - instant loan availability.
</Accordion>

  <Step title="Risk Calculation">

  </Step>

## Borrowing Process

The borrowing workflow adapts to handle any supported token type through the Adaptable Escrow Vault:

### Collateral Deposit

Users select assets and amounts for collateral. The system checks the Adaptable Escrow Vault for asset inclusion. New assets require one-time addition to the vault, then become permanently available for all users.

### Loan Calculation

Based on the value register data and risk profile:
- **LTV Ratio**: 40-80% depending on asset volatility
- **Interest Rate**: 4-12% APR based on risk assessment
- **Liquidation Threshold**: 80-85% of maximum LTV
- **Monitoring Frequency**: Hourly to weekly based on asset type

### Fund Disbursement

Stablecoin loans disburse from the instance's liquidity vault immediately upon collateral lock. No waiting periods or manual approvals for qualified collateral.

## Liquidation System

Automated liquidation protects lenders while maximizing borrower recovery value:

### Liquidation Triggers

The system monitors positions continuously:
- Price drops approaching liquidation threshold
- Missed payments
- Regulatory or compliance violations
- Manual issuer intervention for legal requirements

### Liquidation Process

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Issuer Buyback Hook" icon="hook">

  </Card>
</Columns>

The issuer buyback option enables banks to build portfolios of verified assets at favorable prices. Since banks verified the assets themselves, they trust the data and can acquire quality collateral efficiently.

## Integration Options

### White-Label Module

Deploy the loans module in your white-label platform through the Issuer Platform interface. Users access lending directly within your branded environment.

Module features:
- Deposit and borrow interfaces
- Position management dashboards
- Liquidation monitoring
- Analytics and reporting

### API Integration

Integrate lending into existing applications (register for accessing our overcollateralized loan APIs).

## Risk Management

### Dynamic Risk Profiles

The system adjusts parameters based on asset characteristics:

**Stable Assets** (real estate, bonds): Higher LTV, lower monitoring frequency

**Volatile Assets** (stocks, commodities): Lower LTV, continuous monitoring

**New Assets**: Conservative parameters until history establishes

### Issuer Controls

Banks maintain full control over their lending markets:
- Set accepted collateral types per instance
- Configure maximum exposure limits
- Adjust liquidation parameters
- Pause lending during market stress
- Override automated decisions when required

## Liquidation Bot Contract

Issuers deploy liquidation bots during setup to handle automated liquidations:

```
Bot Configuration:
├── Discount Rate: 5-15% below market price
├── Execution Speed: Immediate or delayed
├── Buyback Priority: Issuer, whitelist, or public
└── Fee Structure: Platform and issuer splits
```

The bot operates autonomously but respects issuer preferences and compliance requirements.

<Note>
Stock tokens provide instant collateral utility through automatic price feeds. Other token types require oracle configuration during issuance for loan eligibility.
