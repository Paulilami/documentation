## Overview

Our asset tokenization system provides the infrastructure for creating, managing, and distributing tokenized representations of real world assets. The system handles token creation with customizable features, supply management, compliance controls, and batch operations for institutional-scale tokenization.

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Token Factory**: Deploys ERC20 tokens with configurable features including KYC, whitelist, transfer restrictions, and fee mechanisms

**Supply Management**: Controls for minting, burning, and managing token supply with optional limits

**Compliance Layer**: User status management for KYC verification, whitelisting, blacklisting, and account freezing

**Batch Processor**: High-throughput system for importing and tokenizing multiple assets from CSV or JSON files

### Smart Contract Infrastructure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| TokenFactory | Central factory for deploying new tokens |
| AssetToken | ERC20 implementation with compliance features |
| UserRegistry | Manages user status and permissions |

## Token Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Token Creation">
    Define token parameters, compliance features, and initial distribution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initial Distribution">
    Allocate tokens to specified recipients during creation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Supply Management">
    Mint additional tokens or burn existing supply as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compliance Control">
    Update user status for KYC, whitelist, and trading permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secondary Transfers">
    Enable compliant peer-to-peer token transfers
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Asset Types

The system supports tokenization of various asset classes:

| Asset Type | Description | Use Cases |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| `EQUITY` | Company shares and ownership | Stock tokenization |
| `BOND` | Debt instruments | Corporate/government bonds |
| `REAL_ESTATE` | Property ownership | Fractional real estate |
| `COMMODITY` | Physical commodities | Gold, silver, oil |
| `FUND` | Investment funds | ETFs, mutual funds |
| `ART` | Artwork and collectibles | Fine art, rare items |
| `CARBON_CREDIT` | Environmental credits | Carbon offset tokens |
| `DEBT_INSTRUMENT` | Loans and receivables | Invoice financing |
| `CASH_EQUIVALENT` | Stable value assets | Money market instruments |

## Token Features

Each token can be configured with specific features:

| Feature | Description | Flag |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `mintable` | Enable minting after deployment | `MINT` |
| `burnable` | Allow token burning | `BURN` |
| `kyc` | Require KYC verification | `KYC` |
| `whitelist` | Restrict to whitelisted addresses | `WHITELIST` |
| `blacklist` | Block blacklisted addresses | `BLACKLIST` |
| `freeze` | Ability to freeze accounts | `FREEZE` |
| `txFee` | Transaction fee mechanism | `TX_FEE` |
| `authority` | Designated authority control | `AUTHORITY` |
| `unlimitedSupply` | No maximum supply cap | `UNLIMITED_SUPPLY` |

## Compliance Framework

### User Status Management
Control user permissions through status flags:
- **Whitelisted**: Approved for token transactions
- **KYC Verified**: Passed identity verification
- **Frozen**: Temporarily suspended from transactions
- **Blacklisted**: Permanently blocked from participation

### Transfer Restrictions
Implement various transfer controls:
- Maximum tokens per wallet
- Monthly transfer limits
- Transaction fee routing
- Authority-only operations

## Batch Operations

Process multiple assets simultaneously for efficient tokenization:

### Supported Formats
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values with headers
- **JSON**: Structured data arrays

### Required Fields
```json
{
  "name": "Asset Name",
  "symbol": "SYMBOL",
  "totalSupply": "1000000",
  "decimals": 18,
  "assetType": "EQUITY",
  "recipients": [
    {
      "address": "0x...",
      "amount": "100000"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key.

<ParamField header="x-api-key" type="string" required>
  Your unique API key provided during onboarding
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="x-instance-id" type="string">
  Optional instance identifier for multi-tenant deployments
</ParamField>

## Response Format

All API responses follow a standardized format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "error": null,
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "requestId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "instanceId": "your-instance-id"
  }
}
```

## Gas Management

The system implements automatic gas optimization:
- Dynamic gas price adjustment (110% of current)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Nonce management for high-throughput operations
- Batch transaction processing
