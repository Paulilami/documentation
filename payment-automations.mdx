description: "Automate on-chain payment workflows with rule-based triggers and scheduled distributions"
---

Automate any on-chain payment workflow using simple rule-based triggers. Set conditions, define actions, and execute complex payment strategies automatically without ongoing costs or manual intervention.

## The Problem

Managing on-chain payments requires constant monitoring and manual execution. Users must watch wallet balances, market conditions, and payment schedules while executing transactions manually. This creates inefficiency and missed opportunities.

Recurring payments, conditional transfers, and automated distributions require technical expertise to implement with custom smart contracts or expensive third-party services.

## The Solution

Two complementary automation systems that handle any payment workflow:

  <Card title="Payment Automations" icon="robot">
    **Rule-Based Triggers**
    
    Automate transfers, conversions, and top-ups based on time, wallet balances, market conditions, or custom triggers.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Payment Streams" icon="calendar-clock">
    **Scheduled Distributions**
    
    Distribute payments to multiple recipients on fixed schedules for royalties, dividends, and recurring payments.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Payment Automations

Execute payment workflows automatically using three simple principles: When, If, Then.

### Core Principles

<Steps>
  <Step title="When: Timing Control">
    - **One-time**: Execute once at a specific date and time
    - **Recurring**: Repeat on schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
    - **Custom**: Complex timing patterns and multiple execution windows
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If: Trigger Conditions">
    - **Wallet Balance**: If wallet balance under/over threshold
    - **Market Data**: If token price or market cap meets conditions via Chainlink oracles
    - **Custom Triggers**: Off-chain data integration and complex logical conditions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Then: Automated Actions">
    - **Transfer**: Send tokens to specified addresses
    - **Top-up**: Maintain minimum wallet balances automatically
    - **Convert**: Swap tokens when conditions are met
    - **Sweep**: Collect funds from multiple wallets
    - **Trigger Streams**: Activate payment distribution schedules
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Automations

<Accordion title="Wallet Maintenance">
  **Scenario**: Keep trading wallet topped up with ETH for gas fees
  
  **Setup**: If ETH balance < 0.1 ETH, then transfer 0.5 ETH from main wallet
  
  **Result**: Never run out of gas fees during trading operations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Market-Based Trading">
  **Scenario**: Buy tokens when price drops below support level
  
  **Setup**: If TRST price < $0.50 (via Chainlink), then convert 1000 USDC to TRST
  
  **Result**: Automated dollar-cost averaging without constant monitoring
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Profit Distribution">
  **Scenario**: Distribute trading profits weekly to team members
  
  **Setup**: Every Friday at 5 PM, trigger payment stream for team distributions
  
  **Result**: Automated payroll and profit sharing without manual processing
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Portfolio Rebalancing">
  **Scenario**: Maintain target asset allocation automatically
  
  **Setup**: If portfolio allocation deviates >10%, then rebalance to target weights
  
  **Result**: Disciplined portfolio management without emotional decisions
</Accordion>

## Payment Streams

Distribute payments to multiple recipients on predefined schedules with flexible access controls and automation integration.

### Access Control Options

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Permissioned Streams" icon="lock">
    **Restricted Access**
    
    Only authorized addresses can fund the stream. Perfect for private investor distributions and team payments.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Open Streams" icon="unlock">
    **Public Funding**
    
    Anyone can contribute to the stream. Ideal for community funding and public revenue sharing.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Use Cases

<Accordion title="Dividend Distributions">
  **Setup**: Monthly stream distributing token revenues to shareholders based on ownership percentages
  
  **Benefits**: Automated compliance with distribution agreements, transparent payment history
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Royalty Payments">
  **Setup**: Quarterly stream paying content creators, artists, or IP holders their revenue share
  
  **Benefits**: Guaranteed payment schedule, reduced administrative overhead
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Team Compensation">
  **Setup**: Bi-weekly stream distributing salaries and bonuses to team members
  
  **Benefits**: Reliable payroll system, automatic tax documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Revenue Sharing">
  **Setup**: Weekly stream distributing platform revenues to token holders and partners
  
  **Benefits**: Transparent revenue sharing, automated profit distribution
</Accordion>

## Technical Features

### Oracle Integration

Payment automations integrate with Chainlink price feeds for real-time market data triggers:

- **Price Triggers**: Execute when token prices cross thresholds
- **Market Cap Conditions**: Trigger based on total market valuation
- **Volume Indicators**: React to trading volume changes
- **Custom Data**: Integration with any Chainlink-supported data feed

### Gas Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple operations to reduce gas costs
- **Conditional Execution**: Only execute when conditions are met

### Security Features

- **Access Controls**: Only authorized addresses can modify automations
- **Emergency Stops**: Pause all automations instantly if needed
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of all automated transactions on-chain
- **Fail-Safe Limits**: Optional maximum transaction amounts and frequency caps

## Cost Structure

<Info>
Payment automations have no ongoing operational costs. Pay only for gas when transactions execute, making complex automation strategies economically viable.
</Info>

## Key Advantages

### Simplicity

Configure complex payment workflows with simple When-If-Then rules. No coding or technical expertise required.

### Reliability

Automations execute exactly as programmed without human error or missed schedules. Smart contracts ensure consistent execution.

### Cost Efficiency

No ongoing fees or subscriptions. Pay only for gas when automations execute, making micro-payments and frequent operations economical.

### Flexibility

Combine payment automations with payment streams for sophisticated financial workflows. Integration with oracles enables market-responsive strategies.

## Integration Capabilities

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

Payment automations work with any ERC20 token and integrate with existing DeFi protocols for enhanced functionality.

### API Integration

Connect with off-chain systems for custom triggers and data sources beyond blockchain-native information. (Coming soon)

### Multi-Chain Support

Deploy identical automation logic across different blockchain networks for diversified operations. (Coming soon)

## Current State
We have successfully finished testing of our payment stream contracts and currently testing our payment automation contracts and will come out with our our mainnet launch.
