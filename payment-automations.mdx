description: "Automate on-chain payment workflows with rule-based triggers and scheduled distributions"
---

Set up rules to automate on-chain payments. Define when something should happen, what conditions to check, and what actions to take.

## The Problem

On-chain payments need constant attention. You have to watch wallet balances, check market prices, and remember payment schedules. Then you execute each transaction by hand.

## The Solution

Two complementary automation systems that handle any payment workflow:

    **Rule-Based Triggers**
    
    Automate transfers, conversions, and top-ups based on time, wallet balances, market conditions, or custom triggers.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Payment Streams" icon="calendar-clock">
    **Scheduled Distributions**
    
    Distribute payments to multiple recipients on fixed schedules for royalties, dividends, and recurring payments.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Payment Automations

Execute payment workflows automatically using three simple principles: When, If, Then.

### Core Principles

<Steps>
  <Step title="When: Timing Control">
    - **One-time**: Execute once at a specific date and time
    - **Recurring**: Repeat on schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
    - **Custom**: Complex timing patterns and multiple execution windows
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If: Trigger Conditions">
    - **Wallet Balance**: If wallet balance under/over threshold
    - **Market Data**: If token price or market cap meets conditions via Chainlink oracles
    - **Custom Triggers**: Off-chain data integration and complex logical conditions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Then: Automated Actions">
    - **Transfer**: Send tokens to specified addresses
    - **Top-up**: Maintain minimum wallet balances automatically
    - **Convert**: Swap tokens when conditions are met
    - **Sweep**: Collect funds from multiple wallets
    - **Trigger Streams**: Activate payment distribution schedules
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Automations

<Accordion title="Wallet Maintenance">
  **Scenario**: Keep trading wallet topped up with ETH for gas fees
  
  **Setup**: If ETH balance < 0.1 ETH, then transfer 0.5 ETH from main wallet
  
  **Result**: Never run out of gas fees during trading operations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Market-Based Trading">
  **Scenario**: Buy tokens when price drops below support level
  
  **Setup**: If TRST price < $0.50 (via Chainlink), then convert 1000 USDC to TRST
  
  **Result**: Automated dollar-cost averaging without constant monitoring
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Profit Distribution">
  **Scenario**: Distribute trading profits weekly to team members
  
  **Setup**: Every Friday at 5 PM, trigger payment stream for team distributions
  
  **Result**: Automated payroll and profit sharing without manual processing
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Portfolio Rebalancing">
  **Scenario**: Maintain target asset allocation automatically
  
  **Setup**: If portfolio allocation deviates >10%, then rebalance to target weights
  
  **Result**: Disciplined portfolio management without emotional decisions
</Accordion>

## Payment Streams

Distribute payments to multiple recipients on predefined schedules with flexible access controls and automation integration.

### Access Control Options

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Permissioned Streams" icon="lock">
    **Restricted Access**
    
    Only authorized addresses can fund the stream. Perfect for private investor distributions and team payments.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Open Streams" icon="unlock">
    **Public Funding**
    
    Anyone can contribute to the stream. Ideal for community funding and public revenue sharing.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Use Cases

<Accordion title="Dividend Distributions">
  **Setup**: Monthly stream distributing token revenues to shareholders based on ownership percentages
  
  **Benefits**: Automated compliance with distribution agreements, transparent payment history
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Royalty Payments">
  **Setup**: Quarterly stream paying content creators, artists, or IP holders their revenue share
  
  **Benefits**: Guaranteed payment schedule, reduced administrative overhead
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Team Compensation">
  **Setup**: Bi-weekly stream distributing salaries and bonuses to team members
  
  **Benefits**: Reliable payroll system, automatic tax documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Revenue Sharing">
  **Setup**: Weekly stream distributing platform revenues to token holders and partners
  
  **Benefits**: Transparent revenue sharing, automated profit distribution
</Accordion>

## Technical Features

### Oracle Integration

Payment automations integrate with Chainlink price feeds for real-time market data triggers:

- **Price Triggers**: Execute when token prices cross thresholds
- **Market Cap Conditions**: Trigger based on total market valuation
- **Volume Indicators**: React to trading volume changes
- **Custom Data**: Integration with any Chainlink-supported data feed

### Gas Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple operations to reduce gas costs
- **Conditional Execution**: Only execute when conditions are met

### Security Features

- **Access Controls**: Only authorized addresses can modify automations
- **Emergency Stops**: Pause all automations instantly if needed
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of all automated transactions on-chain
- **Fail-Safe Limits**: Optional maximum transaction amounts and frequency caps

## Cost Structure

<Info>
Payment automations have no ongoing operational costs. Pay only for gas when transactions execute, making complex automation strategies economically viable.
</Info>

## Key Advantages

### Simple Setup

Configure payment workflows with basic When-If-Then rules. No coding required.

### Reliable Execution

Automations run exactly as programmed. Smart contracts don't forget or make mistakes.

### Cost Effective

No subscription fees. Pay only for gas when automations run.

### Works Together

Combine automations with payment streams for custom workflows. Oracle integration lets you respond to market conditions automatically.
