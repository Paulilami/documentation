## Overview

The Investment Framework provides banks with infrastructure to enable corporate clients to raise capital through tokenized securities. The system handles token creation, primary issuance, secondary trading, and compliance controls within defined legal frameworks.

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Investment Framework**: Manages legal parameters, investment limits, and fee structures for token offerings

**Company Tokens**: ERC20 tokens representing ownership or profit participation rights with transfer restrictions

**Token Marketplace**: Secondary market infrastructure for peer-to-peer token trading
