## The Transformation

Traditional capital markets operate 9-to-5 with T+2 settlement and manual processes. Trusset infrastructure removes those constraints.

Here's what becomes possible:

## Core Capabilities

### 24/7 Asset Trading

Markets never close. Customers trade stocks, bonds, commodities, or any tokenized asset around the clock. Settlement happens in seconds, not days.

No market hours. No waiting periods. No batch processing.

Your institution captures trading fees continuously. We take a small share. You own the infrastructure.

### Instant Borrowing Against Assets

Security tokens were dead capital. We made them instantly liquid collateral.

Customers deposit tokenized shares and borrow against them immediately. Deploy lending solutions with your parameters—price feeds, collateral ratios, liquidation thresholds all automated.

No loan applications. No waiting for approval. No manual collateral management.

### Seconds-Fast Asset Transfers

Send tokenized assets as easily as sending a payment. Transfer stocks, bonds, or fund shares between accounts in seconds.

Built-in compliance ensures only verified investors can receive transfers. Your KYC rules enforce automatically.

### Automated Corporate Actions

Distribute dividends to millions of token holders in a single transaction. Set profit distribution rules once; the system handles recurring payments.

Stock splits, rights issues, tender offers—all executable on-chain with complete audit trails.

## Implementation Examples

</Steps>

Less than 20 lines of code. Full regulatory compliance. Zero prospectus procedures by leveraging legal exemptions.

### Capital Raising Platform

Enable corporate clients to raise capital directly on their website with one "Invest Now" button.

Each issuance follows your bank's framework. Support up to 149 private investors or €8M in public raises. Full issuer control maintained throughout.

The bank provides the compliant framework. The issuer controls their capital raise. Investors get instant liquidity through secondary markets.

### Backend Synchronization

Connect your existing systems without storing data externally:

```javascript
// Sync customer data and verify KYC in one batch
const verification = await trusset.kyc.batchVerify({
  users: customerData,
  level: "enhanced",
  createProofs: true
});

// Mint multiple asset types after 10-minute setup
const tokens = await trusset.tokens.batchMint({
  assets: assetData,
  recipients: verifiedInvestors
});
```

Verify thousands of users on-chain in one operation. Mint multiple asset types without manual processing.

### Overcollateralized Lending

Deploy isolated lending markets for any tokenized asset class:

- Real estate tokens as collateral for liquidity
- Security tokens backing instant credit lines
- Commodity tokens enabling 24/7 financing

Automated risk evaluation, liquidation, and settlement. Your institution defines loan-to-value ratios and manages risk parameters.

### White-Label Investor Platform

Launch a complete branded platform in minutes:

- Tokenization workflows
- Marketplace for secondary trading
- Overcollateralized loan modules
- Integrated KYC verification

Deploy to your domain. Custom themes. Your access requirements. We handle hosting and maintenance.

## Compliance Built-In

- **eWpG Compliant:** Stock tokens issued as electronic securities via German crypto-securities register
- **MiFID II Ready:** Licensed partners maintain full compliance for trading and custody
