## Implementation Examples

### Stock Tokenization Flow
```javascript
// 1. Lock stock position
const lockResponse = await trusset.stocks.lock({
 isin: "US0378331005",
 quantity: 100,
 userId: "customer-123"
});

// 2. Mint tokenized certificates
const mintResponse = await trusset.stocks.mint({
 lockId: lockResponse.id,
 walletAddress: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb0"
});

// 3. Customer burns tokens when ready
// Partner receives webhook to unlock original position
```

### Profit Distribution
```javascript
// One transaction, unlimited recipients.
// Choose between fixes amounts or variable percentages.
await trusset.tokens.distribute({
  tokenAddress: "0x166de8506945798E1aC312A8009102a8c377AE6B",
  recipients: investorAddresses, // Can be millions
  amountPerToken: "0.05", // 5 cents per token
  currency: "USDC"
});
```

### KYC Batch Verification
```javascript
// Sync and verify in one call
const batchResult = await trusset.kyc.batchVerify({
  users: customerData, // Array of user objects
  level: "basic", // or "enhanced"
  createProofs: true
});
// All users now have on-chain verification
```
