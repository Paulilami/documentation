title: "Backend Synchronization"
description: "Connect existing infrastructure to blockchain without changing any code. Stream real-time data and automate on-chain operations."
---

Bridge your traditional systems with blockchain protocols. Push data updates, execute business logic, and automate compliance—all through standard REST APIs. This framework builds a unified synchronization-layer between CeFi and DeFi for financial institutions, while maintaining their independency.

## How It Works

Your backend systems connect to automation vaults that execute transactions on-chain. No manual wallet management. No transaction signing. Just API calls.

Your Systems → REST API → Automation Vault → Smart Contracts

## Core Components

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automation Vaults" icon="robot">
    Deploy vaults that execute transactions automatically. Fund with ETH once, runs indefinitely based on your rules.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data Streaming" icon="link">
    Push real-time updates from your backend. NAV calculations, valuations, and corporate actions sync automatically.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rule Engine" icon="gavel">
    Set conditions for automated actions. If collateral drops 20%, trigger margin call. If rating changes, update permissions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Webhook Listeners" icon="webhook">
    Receive events from your systems and propagate on-chain. Configure once, synchronize forever.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Fund NAV Updates">
    Stream valuations from your portfolio system directly to tokenized fund contracts
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Corporate Actions">
    Automate dividends, splits, and distributions based on backend events
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Risk Management">
    Trigger freeze orders and margin calls from your existing risk engines
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Compliance Updates">
    Propagate KYC/AML status changes and implement automatic freeze orders
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Collateral Monitoring">
    Track asset values and trigger automated adjustments when thresholds are met
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Interest Rate Updates">
    Sync rate changes from your systems to lending protocols in real-time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integration Methods

- **REST API**: Standard HTTP endpoints map your data to on-chain parameters  
- **Scheduled Sync**: Set intervals for regular updates—hourly, daily, or custom triggers  
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time propagation through webhook listeners

## What Gets Synchronized

- Asset valuations and NAV calculations
- Corporate actions (dividends, splits, distributions)
- Compliance states and regulatory updates
- Credit events and rating changes
- Ownership transfers and collateral adjustments
- Insurance status and maintenance records
