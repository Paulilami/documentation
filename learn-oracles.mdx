Verify asset data on-chain through manual verification requests or automated sync links. Connect your existing data systems to provide real-time valuations, risk scores, and asset information directly to the blockchain.

## Data Verification Methods

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Verification Requests" icon="list">
    Manually verify asset data when requested. Review and submit valuations, risk scores, and asset details on-demand.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Sync Links" icon="link">
    Connect your backend APIs for automated data feeds. Update asset information on-chain automatically at set intervals.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Verification Requests

Handle incoming requests to verify asset data:

**Request Management**
- View pending verification requests
- Submit asset valuations and risk scores
- Set validity periods for verifications
- Track verification history

**Data Points**
- Asset name and physical location
- Current valuation in ETH
- Risk scores (market and credit risk)
- Issuer details and documentation

### Sync Links

Create automated connections between your data systems and the blockchain:

**Setup Process**
1. Connect your API endpoint
2. Map your data fields to required formats
3. Set synchronization frequency
4. Test with sample data

**Field Mapping Example**
```json
{
  "your_field": "valuation",
  "risk_metric_1": "riskScore1",
  "risk_metric_2": "riskScore2",
  "property_name": "name"
}
```

## Automation Vault
Enable fully automated synchronization without manual gas management:

### How It Works

- Deposit ETH into the vault contract
- Connect sync links to the vault
- Automated execution handles gas fees
- 10% keeper incentive ensures reliability

**Benefits**

- No manual transaction signing
- Automatic gas optimization
- Continuous data updates
- Balance monitoring

## On-Chain Storage
Asset verifications are stored with:

- Unique reference ID (RWA-[contract]-[assetId])
- Oracle signature and timestamp
- Expiration date
- Full asset metadata


<Warning>
As an oracle, you are responsible for the accuracy of submitted data. Ensure proper validation and authorization before submitting verifications.
</Warning>

<Note>
Test endpoints are available for AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL stock data to validate your integration before connecting production systems.
