## Our Oracle Solution

Our RWA Oracle system lets approved financial institutions submit verified asset data directly to the blockchain. When someone creates a tokenized asset, they need real data about that asset - its value, location, risk profile. That's where our oracles come in.

Think of it like this: You have a tokenized property worth $1.5 million. How does everyone know it's actually worth that? Our oracle system lets trusted institutions verify and update this information on-chain.

## Becoming an Oracle

Financial institutions apply through our Issuer Platform. Once approved, they receive an oracle ID that links their wallet address to their institution. This isn't just any wallet - it's specifically authorized to submit asset verifications.

<Note>
  Each oracle starts with a trust score of 100. Every 10 successful verifications increase this score by 10 points (update will follow soon).
</Note>

## Verification Requests

When someone tokenizes an asset, they can request verification from specific oracles. The request includes:

- Token contract address
- Asset ID within that contract
- Asset type (real estate, commodity, security, etc.)
- Which oracle they want to verify it

As an oracle, you see these pending requests in your dashboard. You can then research the asset and submit verification data including:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Core Data
{
  name: "Downtown Office Building",
  physicalAddress: "123 Main St, New York, NY",
  storageAddress: "Document Vault A-123", 
  issuerDetails: "ABC Property Management LLC",
  signature: "0x..." // Cryptographic proof
}
```

```typescript Valuation & Risk
{
  valuation: "1500000", // In ETH units
  riskScore1: 25,      // Market risk (0-100)
  riskScore2: 15,      // Credit risk (0-100)
  validityPeriod: 30   // Days until re-verification needed
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Sync Links: The Automation Layer

Sync Links are what make our system powerful. Instead of manually verifying each asset, you create an automated connection between your data systems and the blockchain.

### How Sync Links Actually Work

Let's say you're a bank with a database of real estate valuations. You create a Sync Link that:

1. Points to your API endpoint (like `https://api.yourbank.com/properties`)
2. Maps your data fields to our requirements
3. Runs automatically every hour (or whatever frequency you set)

The field mapping is crucial. Your API might return data like this:

```json Example API Response
{
  "property_id": 12345,
  "property_name": "Sunset Plaza",
  "address": {
    "street": "456 Sunset Blvd",
    "city": "Los Angeles"
  },
  "current_appraisal": 2500000,
  "risk_metrics": {
    "market_volatility": 0.15,
    "tenant_risk": 0.08
  }
}
```

You then map these fields:
- `property_name` → Asset Name
- `address.street + address.city` → Physical Address  
- `current_appraisal` → Valuation
- `risk_metrics.market_volatility * 100` → Risk Score 1
- `risk_metrics.tenant_risk * 100` → Risk Score 2

<Info>
  Your API credentials are encrypted before storage. The smart contract never sees your actual API keys.
</Info>

### Creating a Sync Link

When you create a Sync Link, you specify:

- **Token Contract**: Which tokenized assets to update
- **Specific Token IDs**: Update all tokens or just specific ones
- **API Endpoint**: Where we fetch the data
- **Field Mappings**: How your data translates to our format
- **Sync Frequency**: How often to check for updates (default: 3600 seconds)

The system then automatically fetches data from your endpoint and submits it on-chain at the specified intervals.

## Reference IDs and Data Access

Every verification gets a unique reference ID: `RWA-[contract address]-[asset ID]`

For example: `RWA-0x1234...5678-42`

This ID lets anyone look up the verification data on-chain. They can see:
- Which oracle verified it
- When it was verified
- All the asset details
- When it expires

## Testing Your Integration

We provide preset endpoints for testing:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Stock Data">
    Test with real-time stock data from major companies:
    - Apple (AAPL)
    - Microsoft (MSFT)
    - Google (GOOGL)
    
    These endpoints return properly formatted data with price as valuation and volatility as risk score.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Custom Test">
    Use our test endpoint that returns sample real estate data:
    ```
    /api/oracle/test-sync-endpoint
    ```
    
    This returns a complete property dataset you can use to test field mappings.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Your Oracle Status

Through the Issuer Platform, you can:

- View all pending verification requests
- See which requests want Sync Link access
- Monitor your trust score and total verifications
- Update existing Sync Links
- Deactivate Sync Links you no longer need

<Warning>
  Once you submit a verification, it's permanent on-chain. You can submit new verifications but cannot edit old ones.
</Warning>

## Why This Matters

Traditional tokenization platforms struggle with data freshness. An asset gets tokenized with a $1M valuation, but six months later, is it still worth $1M? Our oracle system solves this by:

1. **Continuous Updates**: Sync Links keep valuations current
2. **Trust Building**: Verification counts and scores show reliability
3. **Audit Trails**: Every verification is timestamped and traceable
4. **Flexibility**: Verify anything from real estate to art to commodities

## Technical Details

The smart contract stores verifications in a mapping structure:
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint32 => AssetVerification)) public verifications
```

This means for any token contract and asset ID combination, there's at most one active verification. New verifications overwrite old ones, but the history remains in the blockchain events.

Sync Links store encrypted credentials as bytes:
```solidity
bytes encryptedCredentials
```

Your actual API keys are encrypted client-side before being sent to the contract.
