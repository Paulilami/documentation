The Stock Exchange API provides the functionality for issuing eWpG-compliant electronic securities (including tokenized stocks), managing corporate actions, and ensuring regulatory compliance under German and EU law.

## Overview

Our Stock Exchange infrastructure enables:

- **Electronic Stock Issuance (eWpG)**: Convert traditional stocks into electronic securities recorded in the German crypto-securities register
- **Corporate Actions**: Execute stock splits, dividends, delistings, and trading halts
- **Lifecycle Management**: Track positions from lock to unlock with register updates
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in controls for register operations, trading halts, and blacklisting
- **Dividend Distribution**: Automated dividend pools and payments
