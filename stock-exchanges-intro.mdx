The Stock Exchange API provides comprehensive functionality for tokenizing real-world stocks, managing corporate actions, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Overview

Our Stock Exchange infrastructure enables:

- **Stock Tokenization**: Convert traditional stocks into blockchain tokens
- **Corporate Actions**: Execute stock splits, dividends, delistings, and trading halts
- **Lifecycle Management**: Track positions from lock to unlock
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in controls for trading halts and blacklisting
- **Dividend Distribution**: Automated dividend pools and payments

## Architecture

The Stock Exchange system consists of three main components:

1. **Stock Factory Contract**: Deploys and manages stock tokens
2. **Corporate Actions Module**: Schedules and executes corporate events
3. **Dividend Distributor**: Manages dividend pools and payments

## Authentication

All endpoints require API key authentication:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

For admin endpoints, include a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
