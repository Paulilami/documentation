# Platform Overview

The Trusset Security Token Demo Platform is a comprehensive infrastructure for creating, managing, and transacting with security tokens on the blockchain. It implements the German Electronic Securities Act (eWpG) requirements within a blockchain environment.

## Core Concepts

### Security Tokens

Security tokens are digital representations of traditional securities on the blockchain. Unlike utility tokens or cryptocurrencies, security tokens:

- Represent ownership of regulated financial instruments
- Comply with securities regulations
- Maintain investor protections and compliance controls
- Enable automated compliance, governance, and lifecycle management

### Asset Register

Central to the Trusset platform is the Asset Register, which:

- Maintains immutable records of token ownership
- Tracks all transfers and lifecycle events
- Enables regulatory reporting
- Provides a complete audit trail

## Platform Architecture

The Trusset platform consists of several interconnected components:

### Contract Layer

The smart contract layer includes:

- **SecurityToken**: Core contract for token operations
- **AssetFactory**: Creates and configures tokens
- **AssetRegister**: Maintains ownership records
- **Compliance**: Manages regulatory requirements
- **SecurityManagement**: Handles token governance
- **TokenOracle**: Provides price and valuation services

### Data Layer

The platform stores token data across several structures:

- **AssetCore**: Basic token parameters
- **AssetExtras**: Extended token configurations
- **Batches**: Ownership records by token batch
- **Documents**: Linked legal and compliance documents
- **Tags**: Custom metadata and rights

### Application Layer

The user-facing application provides:

- Token creation and management interface
- Compliance management tools
- Document management
- Ownership and transfer tools
- Dashboard and analytics

## Use Cases

The Trusset platform supports various security token applications:

### Corporate Finance
