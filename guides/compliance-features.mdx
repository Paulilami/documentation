# Compliance Features

Trusset's platform includes robust compliance tools designed to meet regulatory requirements for security tokens. This guide explains the available compliance features and how to implement them.

## Available Compliance Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="KYC Verification" defaultOpen={true}>
    Require Know Your Customer verification for token holders.
    
    **How it works**: When enabled, only addresses that have passed KYC verification can hold or transfer the token.
    
    **When to use**: Required for most regulated securities, especially when dealing with retail investors.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Whitelisting">
    Maintain a list of approved addresses that can hold the token.
    
    **How it works**: Only addresses on the whitelist can receive token transfers.
    
    **When to use**: For private offerings, investor qualification, or geographic restrictions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Blacklisting">
    Prevent specific addresses from holding the token.
    
    **How it works**: Addresses on the blacklist cannot receive token transfers.
    
    **When to use**: To enforce legal orders, address regulatory concerns, or manage sanctions compliance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Account Freezing">
    Temporarily suspend an account's ability to transfer tokens.
    
    **How it works**: Frozen accounts cannot send or receive tokens until unfrozen.
    
    **When to use**: During investigations, legal disputes, or to mitigate security incidents.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transfer Limits">
    Restrict the number of transfers an address can make within a time period.
    
    **How it works**: Set a maximum number of transfers per month per address.
    
    **When to use**: To prevent market manipulation or follow specific regulatory requirements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Maximum Per Wallet">
    Limit how many tokens can be held by a single wallet.
    
    **How it works**: Transfers that would exceed the wallet's limit are rejected.
    
    **When to use**: To ensure broad distribution and prevent concentration of ownership.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document Management">
    Attach regulatory and compliance documents to tokens.
    
    **How it works**: Documents can be linked to the entire token or to specific shares.
    
    **When to use**: For disclosure requirements, terms of service, investor agreements, etc.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forced Transfers">
    Allow authorized addresses to move tokens between accounts.
    
    **How it works**: Authorized addresses can execute transfers without the sender's signature.
    
    **When to use**: For legal enforcement, court orders, or regulatory actions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Enabling Compliance Features

Compliance features are enabled when creating the token:

1. When using `createComplianceAsset`:
   ```typescript
   createComplianceAsset(
     name,
     symbol,
     initialSupply,
     headerImage,
     maxSupply,
     authority,
     enableKYC,          // Set to true to enable KYC
     enableBlacklist,    // Set to true to enable blacklisting
     enableWhitelist,    // Set to true to enable whitelisting
     enableFreeze,       // Set to true to enable freezing
     assetType
   )
   ```

2. When using `createFullyConfiguredAsset`, set the appropriate flags:
   ```typescript
   const flags = processFlags(
     canMint,
     canBurn,
     hasKYC,             // KYC requirement
     hasBlacklist,       // Blacklisting
     hasWhitelist,       // Whitelisting
     hasFreeze,          // Account freezing
     hasPause,           // Token pausing
     hasDocs,            // Document linking
     hasTags,            // Custom tags
     hasLinkedDocs,      // Share-specific documents
     hasMintFee,
     hasBurnFee,
     hasTxFee,
     isDecentralized,
     hasAuthority,
     hasForce,           // Forced transfers
     hasMaxWallet,       // Maximum per wallet
     registerAsset,
     burnByOwner,
     hasMonthlyTransferLimit, // Transfer rate limiting
     concealDocs
   )
   ```

- Document disclosure requirements

### European Union

- MiCA regulations for crypto-assets
- GDPR implications for personal data
- Document requirements under prospectus regulation

<Note>
Always consult with legal counsel for specific regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction. This documentation provides technical guidance but not legal advice.
</Note>

## Compliance Best Practices

1. **Documentation**: Keep clear records of all compliance actions and decisions

2. **Consistent Enforcement**: Apply compliance rules consistently

3. **Regular Review**: Periodically audit compliance settings and holder status

4. **Transparent Communication**: Clearly communicate compliance requirements to token holders

5. **Legal Review**: Have legal experts review your compliance implementation
