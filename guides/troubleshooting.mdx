# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you identify and resolve common issues with the Trusset security token platform.

## Connection Issues

### Wallet Not Connecting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Network">
    **Problem**: You're connected to the wrong blockchain network.
    
    **Solution**: Switch to Sepolia testnet in your wallet.
    
    In MetaMask:
    1. Open MetaMask
    2. Click on the network dropdown at the top
    3. Select "Sepolia Test Network"
    4. If not visible, add Sepolia with these parameters:
       - Network Name: `Sepolia Test Network`
       - RPC URL: `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/`
       - Chain ID: `11155111`
       - Currency Symbol: `ETH`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Browser Permissions">
    **Problem**: Browser is blocking wallet connection.
    
    **Solution**: Check permissions and popups.
    
    1. Ensure popups are not blocked
    2. Check that the wallet extension has permissions for the site
    3. Try refreshing the page
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wallet Lock">
    **Problem**: Wallet is locked.
    
    **Solution**: Unlock your wallet.
    
    1. Open your wallet extension
    2. Enter your password to unlock
    3. Try connecting again
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Transaction Issues

### Transaction Failing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Insufficient Gas">
    **Problem**: Not enough ETH for transaction fees.
    
    **Solution**: Ensure you have enough Sepolia ETH.
    
    1. Check your Sepolia ETH balance
    2. If low, get more from [Google Cloud Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)
    3. Retry transaction with sufficient balance
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Compliance Restrictions">
    **Problem**: Transaction violates compliance rules.
    
    **Solution**: Check error messages and compliance settings.
    
    Common compliance errors:
    - `KYC`: Recipient hasn't completed KYC
    - `WHITELIST`: Address not on whitelist
    - `BLACKLIST`: Address is blacklisted
    - `FROZEN`: Account is frozen
    - `MAX`: Exceeds maximum tokens per wallet
    - `MONTHLY_LIMIT`: Exceeds monthly transfer limit
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Contract Permissions">
    **Problem**: You don't have permission for the action.
    
    **Solution**: Verify your permissions.
    
    Errors like `NOT_CREATOR`, `NOT_OWNER`, or `NOT_AUTHORIZED` indicate you're trying to perform an action that requires specific permissions.
    
    1. Check if you're using the correct wallet address
    2. Verify you have the necessary role for the operation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Failed Token Creation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Parameters">
    **Problem**: Token creation parameters are invalid.
    
    **Solution**: Check parameter errors.
    
    Common parameter errors:
    - `INVALID_SUPPLY`: Supply values are incorrect
    - `INVALID_FEE_RECEIVER`: Missing fee receiver address
    - Name or symbol format issues
    
    Ensure all required fields are filled correctly and match the expected formats.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Contract Errors">
    **Problem**: Smart contract error during creation.
    
    **Solution**: Check error message and fix accordingly.
    
    1. Look for specific error codes in the transaction message
    2. For complex setups, try creating a simpler token first
    3. Ensure flag combinations are valid (see [Token Flags](/learn/token-flags))
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Token Management Issues

### Missing Tokens

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Token Visibility">
    **Problem**: Tokens not showing in UI.
    
    **Solution**: Refresh and verify connection.
    
    1. Refresh the page
    2. Ensure your wallet is connected
    3. Verify you're connected to Sepolia testnet
    4. Check that you're using the same wallet address that owns the tokens
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transaction Not Mined">
    **Problem**: Transaction hasn't been confirmed yet.
    
    **Solution**: Check transaction status.
    
    1. Check your wallet for pending transactions
    2. Verify transaction on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)
    3. If stuck, you may need to speed up or cancel the transaction in your wallet
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Failed Transfers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Compliance Checks">
    **Problem**: Transfer fails compliance checks.
    
    **Solution**: Review compliance requirements.
    
    1. Check if recipient is whitelisted (if required)
    2. Verify recipient has completed KYC (if required)
    3. Make sure recipient isn't blacklisted
    4. Confirm the transfer doesn't exceed per-wallet limits
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Paused Token">
    **Problem**: Token is currently paused.
    
    **Solution**: Check token status.
    
    1. Go to token details to see if token is paused
    2. If paused, wait until the pause period ends
    3. If you're the token creator, you can unpause it
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check for any console errors in your browser's developer tools
2. Review [contract architecture](/learn/contract-architecture) for deeper understanding
3. Contact the Trusset team via the support form on [demo.trusset.org](https://demo.trusset.org)

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use mainnet Ethereum instead of Sepolia?">
    The demo platform currently only works on Sepolia testnet. For production deployments on mainnet, contact the Trusset team directly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I can't see my documents after linking them">
    Document links are stored on-chain, but the documents themselves are stored at the URL you provided. Make sure:
    1. The URL is accessible
    2. You have permission to view the documents
    3. You're logged in as the same account that created the token
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I recover tokens sent to the wrong address?">
    If the token has the `FORCE` flag enabled and you are the creator or authority:
    1. Use the force transfer function to move tokens back
    2. Provide a valid reason and documentation
    
    If the token doesn't have this feature, recovery may not be possible.
