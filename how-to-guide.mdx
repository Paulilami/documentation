This guide walks you through every feature of the platform. Test the system, send feedback, create tokens, and trade assets on Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

<Warning>
  This is a test environment. All transactions use testnet tokens with no real value.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Wallet">
    Install and connect <Tooltip tip="MetaMask is a browser extension that manages your Ethereum wallet">MetaMask</Tooltip> to access the platform since it's the easiest option.

    <Card title="Install MetaMask" icon="wallet" href="https://metamask.io/download/">
      Download MetaMask browser extension and create your wallet
    </Card>

    Connect your wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Switch to Sepolia Network">
    The platform runs on <Tooltip tip="Ethereum test network where transactions cost nothing">Ethereum Sepolia testnet</Tooltip>. Add the network to MetaMask by clicking the top left icon button to show all networks, scroll down and click "show test networks", and click on "Sepolia", or manually add it by inputting:

    ```json Network Configuration
    {
      "networkName": "Sepolia Test Network",
      "rpcUrl": "https://rpc.sepolia.org",
      "chainId": "11155111",
      "symbol": "SepoliaETH",
      "blockExplorer": "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
    }
    ```

    <Info>
      MetaMask usually includes Sepolia by default. Enable it in Settings → Advanced → Show test networks.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Testnet Tokens">
    Request free Sepolia ETH from the <Tooltip tip="Service that gives free testnet tokens for development">Google Cloud faucet</Tooltip>:

## Creating Tokens

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using a Verification Pass" icon="shield-check">
    <Tooltip tip="Cryptographic container of token parameters to compliantly create security tokens in a secure environment">Verification Passes</Tooltip> enable compliant token creation without any communication needs between issuer and receiver.

    **Getting a Pass:**
    Verification Passes are issued by authorized entities after completing verification requirements, since this is for demonstration, anyone can currently issue a vPass and test functionality. Contact hello@trusset.de to become an issuer when we launch on mainnet.

    **Creating Tokens with a Pass:**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Approve Pass Usage">
        Select your Verification Pass and approve the data for token creation.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Token">
        Change unlocked fields if needed, and create your tokens with one click compliantly.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      Verification Passes unlock features like <Tooltip tip="Lists of approved addresses that can receive tokens">whitelisting</Tooltip>, KYC requirements, compliance reporting, and much more.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Creating Without Verification Pass" icon="coins">
    Create basic tokens without additional verification requirements.

    **Required Fields:**
    - Token name (e.g., "Property Token A")
    - Token symbol (e.g., "PTA")
    - Total supply
    - <Tooltip tip="Number of decimal places - determines smallest unit of the token">Decimals</Tooltip> (default: 1), (18 with next update).

    **Optional Features:**
    - **Compliance**: Add regulatory compliance metadata
    - **Documents**: Attach legal documents or asset information
    - **Tags**: Categorize your token (real estate, art, commodities)
    - **Transfer restrictions**: Enable <Tooltip tip="Control who can receive or send tokens">whitelisting or blacklisting</Tooltip>

    <CodeGroup>
      ```typescript Token Creation
      const tokenParams = {
        name: "My Asset",
        symbol: "MINE", 
        totalSupply: "100",
        decimals: 1,
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    **Error Handling:**
    - **Insufficient funds**: Ensure you have enough Sepolia ETH for gas fees
    - **Invalid parameters**: Check all required fields are filled correctly
    - **Network issues**: Verify your connection to Sepolia network
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Issuing a Verification Pass

<Warning>
  Currently, anyone can create and test our verification passes (vPasses), when we launch on mainnet, only authorized partners can issue them.
</Warning>

**Required Fields:**
- Recipient wallet address: Automatic KYC validation and verification if needed.
- Expiration date: Expiry of the vPass which makes it unusable. 
- All other input fields are optional

**Locking Fields:**
Issuers can lock specific fields so they cannot be changed by the recepient. Any field can be locked, this allows recepients to securely create the tokens without modifying crucial fields.
