title: "Token Creation"
description: "Create ERC1400-based security tokens with integrated compliance and transfer restrictions"
---

Create security tokens that represent ownership of real-world assets. The system supports two creation paths: direct token creation for testing and compliant token creation through verified issuers.

## How Token Creation Works

The protocol uses ERC1400-based smart contracts with custom extensions for asset tokenization. Each token represents fractional ownership of an underlying asset with programmable compliance rules.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct Creation" icon="plus">
    **Anyone can create tokens**
    
    Create tokens immediately for testing or non-regulated use cases. No verification required.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Compliant Creation" icon="shield-check">
    **Requires verification pass**
    
    Create fully compliant tokens using verification passes from licensed issuers in our network.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Verification Pass System

Verification passes (vPasses) contain pre-approved parameters for compliant token creation. Licensed issuers create these passes after completing legal and regulatory requirements.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Issuer Approval">
    Licensed issuer reviews your asset and creates a verification pass with approved parameters.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pass Delivery">
    Verification pass is delivered to your wallet address automatically. No manual communication required.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Token Creation">
    Use the verification pass to create compliant tokens with one click. All compliance rules are built into the token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Verification passes appear automatically in your interface when available. Simply select and approve to create compliant tokens.

## Token Features

Security tokens include programmable features for compliance, management, and operation:

### Transfer Controls

<Accordion title="KYC Requirements">
  Require users to complete identity verification before token transfers. Automatically enforced by smart contracts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Whitelist Management">
  Restrict token transfers to pre-approved addresses only. Useful for private placements and regulated securities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Blacklist Protection">
  Block specific addresses from receiving or sending tokens. Helps maintain regulatory compliance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Account Freezing">
  Temporarily freeze specific accounts while maintaining all other token functionality. Used for compliance investigations.
</Accordion>

### Supply Management

<Accordion title="Mint Controls">
  Enable or disable token minting after initial creation. Set maximum supply limits or allow unlimited supply.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Burn Capability">
  Allow token holders to burn their tokens, reducing total supply. Useful for buyback programs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monthly Limits">
  Set monthly transfer limits per wallet address. Helps prevent market manipulation and ensures orderly trading.
</Accordion>

### Asset Documentation

<Accordion title="Document Storage">
  Attach legal documents, certificates, and asset information directly to tokens using IPFS storage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Asset Tagging">
  Add searchable tags to categorize and identify token properties and characteristics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Header Images">
  Set visual representations for tokens to improve user experience and asset identification.
</Accordion>

## Asset Types

The protocol supports tokenization of various asset classes:

  <Card title="Financial Assets" icon="chart-line">
    Equity, bonds, funds, debt instruments, cash equivalents
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Physical Assets" icon="building">
    Real estate, art, collectibles, commodities
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Intellectual Property" icon="lightbulb">
    Patents, trademarks, music rights, film rights, licenses
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Digital Assets" icon="microchip">
    Data assets, carbon credits, game items, domain names
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Fee Structure

Token creators can configure fee collection for various operations:

| Operation | Fee Type | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Token Minting | Configurable BPS | Revenue generation for issuers |
| Token Burning | Configurable BPS | Processing and administrative costs |
| Transfers | Configurable BPS | Transaction processing fees |

<Note>
All fees are optional and configurable. Many tokens operate with zero fees for basic transfers.
</Note>

## Creation Process
