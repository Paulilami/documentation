## Compliance Integration

All trades enforce your token's compliance rules automatically:
- KYC verification requirements
- Transfer restrictions
- Wallet limits
- Geographic restrictions

The platform connects directly to your instance's deployed tokens. No additional setup required.

Asset financing requires additional configuration for credit parameters and down payment requirements. Contact support for setup assistance.
