The trading platform module adapts to your token type automatically. Security tokens route through compliance-checked markets while ERC20 tokens connect to automated market makers. Configure through the Issuer Platform or integrate via API.

## Trading Infrastructure

### Security Token Marketplace

Security tokens (ERC1400) trade through structured mechanisms that maintain compliance throughout the transaction lifecycle. Each trade validates KYC status, transfer restrictions, and wallet limits before execution.

  <Card title="Direct Listings" icon="tag">
    Fixed-price sales with immediate settlement and automatic compliance checks
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Asset Financing" icon="credit-card">
    Purchase with 25-80% down payment and structured monthly payments
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Auctions" icon="gavel">
    Time-bound competitive bidding for price discovery on unique assets
  </Card>
</Columns>

The marketplace operates at the instance level - only tokens issued within the same instance appear in the marketplace. This isolation ensures proper compliance boundaries and simplified management.

### ERC20 Token Trading

Stock tokens and standard ERC20s utilize Balancer V3 liquidity pools for continuous 24/7 trading with custom hooks. The automated market maker eliminates order books and manual matching.

Pool mechanics:
- Automatic price discovery based on token ratios
- 0.3% swap fees distributed to liquidity providers
- No minimum trade sizes or time restrictions
- Instant execution without counterparty matching

## Asset Financing Details

The financing module enables structured purchases through smart contract enforcement. Sellers become lenders, earning interest while maintaining token security through escrow.

### Down Payment Structure

Lower down payments increase risk, reflected in higher interest rates:

| Down Payment | Interest Rate | Maximum Term | Monthly Payment |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 25-40% | 12-15% APR | 5 years | Higher monthly burden |
| 40-60% | 8-12% APR | 10 years | Moderate payments |
| 60-80% | 4-8% APR | 30 years | Lower monthly cost |

### Financing Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Listing Creation">
    Seller sets minimum down payment, maximum duration, and acceptable borrower criteria
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Purchase Initiation">
    Buyer selects down payment percentage within seller's parameters and loan duration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Escrow Lock">
    Tokens transfer to smart contract escrow, released only upon full payment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payment Collection">
    Monthly automated payments process on schedule with principal and interest
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Completion or Default">
    Full payment releases tokens to buyer. Default returns tokens to seller plus penalties
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Default Protection

The system protects sellers through multiple mechanisms:

**Immediate Penalties**: Seller keeps the down payment plus 2.5% penalty fee on default

**Credit Tracking**: Defaulters receive on-chain credit marks affecting future financing access

**Automatic Reversion**: Tokens return to seller automatically without manual intervention

**Payment History**: Complete payment records stored on-chain for dispute resolution

## Configuration Options

### Module Setup

Configure the trading platform through the Issuer Platform interface:

```
Trading Permissions:
├── List Assets: Allow token holders to create listings
├── Buy Assets: Enable purchase functionality
├── Create Auctions: Permit auction creation
└── Use Financing: Allow financed purchases

Trading Features:
├── Instant Buy: Direct purchase at listed prices
├── Auction System: Time-based bidding
├── Escrow Service: Secure transaction settlement
└── Rating System: Buyer/seller reputation tracking
```

### Liquidity Pool Management

For ERC20 tokens using Balancer pools:

**Initial Setup**: Deploy pools with starting liquidity and weight ratios through the interface

**Fee Configuration**: Set swap fees between 0.1% and 1% based on volatility expectations

**Liquidity Incentives**: Configure rewards for liquidity providers to bootstrap markets

**Access Control**: Determine who can provide liquidity - public, whitelist, or issuer-only

## API Integration

While the module deploys through the Issuer Platform, programmatic access enables automation:

### Creating Listings
```javascript
POST /api/marketplace/list
{
  tokenAddress: "0x...",
  amount: "1000",
  price: "50000",
  acceptFinancing: true,
  minDownPayment: 40,
  maxDuration: 60
}
```

### Executing Trades
```javascript
POST /api/marketplace/buy
{
  listingId: "listing_123",
  financingOption: {
    downPayment: 50,
    durationMonths: 36
  }
}
```

### Pool Operations
```javascript
POST /api/balancer/swap
{
  tokenIn: "0x...",
  tokenOut: "0x...",
  amount: "1000",
  minAmountOut: "950"
}
```

## Compliance Integration

All trades enforce token-level compliance automatically. The platform checks:

**Identity Verification**: KYC status validation before any transfer

**Transfer Restrictions**: Blacklists, whitelists, and freeze status

**Regulatory Limits**: Maximum holders, minimum holdings, geographic restrictions

**Time Locks**: Vesting schedules and transfer moratoriums

Failed compliance checks reject transactions before blockchain execution, saving gas costs and maintaining regulatory adherence.

## Market Analytics

The trading platform provides comprehensive analytics through dashboards and API endpoints:

- Volume metrics by token and time period
- Price movements and liquidity depth
- Financing utilization and default rates
- User activity and retention metrics
- Compliance rejection reasons and patterns

Export data for reporting or integrate with existing business intelligence tools through the API.

<Note>
Trading platforms operate at the instance level. Tokens from different instances cannot trade together, maintaining clear compliance and operational boundaries.
