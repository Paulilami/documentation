A decentralized marketplace for trading tokenized real-world assets. We enable direct peer-to-peer trading of security tokens with built-in compliance and 3rd-party analytics, fractional ownership, and integrated financing options.

## How Trading Works

Users trade security tokens representing fractional ownership of real-world assets. The marketplace operates entirely on-chain without centralized intermediaries controlling transactions or custody.

### Admin-Key Management
We distribute admin keys among trusted issuers and partners for compliance. Legally, we maintain control over contract updates until development is complete.

### APIs
Our APIs (coming soon) let anyone launch their own marketplace for security tokens. You can customize and deploy securely in minutes. This gives you two options: launch your project instantly on our existing marketplace with built-in buyers, or create your own marketplace from scratch.
