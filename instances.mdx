Instances are isolated environments that control access to Trusset's API services on your chosen blockchain network. Each instance operates independently with its own API key and configuration.

## Instance Types

Every instance is dedicated to one service type (stablecoin instances coming soon):

  <Card title="Tokenization Instance" icon="coins">
    Access to token creation, management, and white-label platform deployment services.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Synchronization (Oracle) Instance" icon="database">
    Access to our synchronization and oracle services.
  </Card>
   <Card title="Stablecoin Instance" icon="coin">
    Access to stablecoin issuance, management services, monitoring, conversion workdlows, and more.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Note>
  Stablecoin instances are not mandatory, you can access our stablecoin APIs through your **tokenization** instance API keys.
</Note>

## Integrated Blockchains
Your instance's services (and the underlying smart contracts) will automatically adapt to the chosen blockchain network when the instance is created. The network cannot be changed after the instance is created. We will soon integrate our own bridge.

## Environment Modes

Each instance operates in one of two modes:

- **Development**: For testing and integration. Full API access without affecting production data. Automatically deploys contracts on testnet.
- **Production**: For live operations with real assets and transactions. Automatically deploys contracts on mainnet.

## API Keys
Visit [API Key Management](/api-key-management)


## Service Isolation

- Complete data separation between instances
- Independent rate limits and usage tracking
- Separate webhook configurations per instance

## Limits
You get a general limit of five tokenization- and five synchronization instances. 

## Getting Started

1. Log into the [Issuer Platform](https://issuers.trusset.org/)
2. Click "Create Instance"
3. Select service type (Tokenization or Oracle)
4. Choose environment (Development or Production)
5. Copy your API key

All subsequent API calls will require this instance API key in the `x-api-key` header.

<Note>
  Instances are free to create. You only pay for the services you use through each instance.
