Instances are isolated environments that control access to Trusset's API services. Each instance operates independently with its own API key and configuration.

## Instance Types

Every instance is dedicated to one service type (stablecoin instances coming soon):

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="Tokenization Instance" icon="coins">
    Access to token creation, management, and white-label platform deployment services.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Synchronization Instance" icon="database">
    Access to our synchronization and oracle services.
  </Card>
   <Card title="Stablecoin Instance" icon="coin">
    Access to stablecoin issuance, management services, monitoring, conversion workdlows, and more.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Note>
  Stablecoin instances are not mandatory, you can access our stablecoin APIs through your **tokenization** instance API keys.

## Environment Modes

Each instance operates in one of two modes:

- **Development**: For testing and integration. Full API access without affecting production data.
- **Production**: For live operations with real assets and transactions.

## Instance Management

### API Keys

- Each instance has a unique API key for authentication
- Keys can be regenerated at any time through the Issuer Platform
- All API requests require the instance API key in headers

### Service Isolation

- Complete data separation between instances
- Independent rate limits and usage tracking
- Separate webhook configurations per instance

## Getting Started

1. Log into the [Issuer Platform](https://issuers.trusset.org/)
2. Click "Create Instance"
3. Select service type (Tokenization or Oracle)
4. Choose environment (Development or Production)
5. Copy your API key

All subsequent API calls will require this instance API key in the `x-api-key` header.

<Note>
  Instances are free to create. You only pay for the services you use through each instance.
