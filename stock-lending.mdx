# Collateralized Lending

Tokenized stocks represent significant value locked on-chain. Our lending protocol enables holders to access liquidity without selling their positions, while institutions can deploy capital efficiently through isolated lending markets.

## Core Architecture

The lending system operates through isolated instances that separate risk between institutions:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Instance Isolation" icon="vault">
    Each institution operates independent lending markets
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Pricing" icon="percentage">
    Interest rates adjust with supply and demand
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated Risk" icon="shield">
    Liquidations execute without manual intervention
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Economic Model

### Collateral Valuation

Stock tokens deposited as collateral receive a risk-adjusted valuation:

```
Borrowing Power = Stock Value × Collateral Factor

Example:
$10,000 worth of stock × 75% factor = $7,500 borrowing capacity
```

The collateral factor reflects the asset's liquidity and volatility. More liquid stocks with deeper trading pools receive higher collateral factors, typically ranging from 70% to 80%.

### Interest Rate Dynamics

Interest rates follow a kinked model with three distinct phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Low Utilization (0-80%)">
    Rates increase linearly from base rate (2-3% APY) to encourage borrowing activity while maintaining affordable costs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optimal Range (80%)">
    The kink point where supply and demand balance. This target utilization ensures liquidity for withdrawals while maximizing capital efficiency.
  </Step>

  <Step title="High Utilization (80-100%)">
    Rates increase sharply to discourage excessive borrowing. This protects suppliers from being unable to withdraw their funds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rate Mathematics

The interest model uses continuous compounding with these formulas:

**Below Optimal Utilization:**
```
Borrow Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization × Slope)
```

**Above Optimal Utilization:**
```
Borrow Rate = Base Rate + (Kink × Slope) + 
              ((Utilization - Kink) × Jump Multiplier)
```

**Supply Rate Calculation:**
```
Supply Rate = Borrow Rate × Utilization × Protocol Share

Protocol Share = 75% (25% reserved for insurance)
```

## Risk Framework

### Health Factor Model

The health factor determines when positions become eligible for liquidation:

```
Health Factor = (Collateral Value × Liquidation Threshold) / Total Debt

Safe Zone: > 1.2
Warning Zone: 1.0 - 1.2
Liquidation Zone: < 1.0
```

This buffer between collateral factor (75%) and liquidation threshold (80%) provides borrowers time to respond to market movements before liquidation.

### Liquidation Mechanics

Liquidations follow a partial model to minimize borrower losses:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Liquidation Trigger">
    When health factor drops below 1.0, the position enters liquidation status. Any participant can initiate liquidation by repaying debt.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Partial Liquidation">
    Maximum 50% of debt can be liquidated per transaction. This gives borrowers opportunity to add collateral or repay before complete liquidation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Liquidation Incentive">
    Liquidators receive a 5% bonus on seized collateral. This incentive ensures prompt liquidation of risky positions, protecting the protocol.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bad Debt Socialization">
    If collateral value falls below debt (underwater position), the insurance fund covers the shortfall. This protects lenders from losses.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Price Dependencies

The system relies on oracle prices for critical functions:

| Function | Price Source | Validation |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Borrowing | TWAP 30-minute | Maximum 2% deviation from spot |
| Monitoring | Spot price | 5-minute staleness check |
| Liquidation | Conservative price | Lower of spot and TWAP |

Price manipulation protection includes:
- Multiple oracle sources with median aggregation
- Maximum acceptable deviation thresholds
- Circuit breakers for extreme movements
- Delayed liquidation execution

## Insurance Mechanism

### Fund Structure

The insurance fund provides a backstop against protocol losses:

```
Fund Sources:
- 25% of interest spread
- Liquidation penalties (partial)
- Direct deposits from institution

Target Size: 5% of Total Value Locked
Minimum Size: 2% of Total Value Locked
```

### Loss Coverage Hierarchy

When losses occur, the protocol follows this absorption order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Liquidation Penalty">
    5% bonus from liquidated collateral covers initial shortfall
  </Step>

  <Step title="Insurance Fund">
    Accumulated reserves cover remaining bad debt
  </Step>

  <Step title="Socialized Loss">
    If insurance depleted, loss distributed pro-rata to lenders
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Operational Dependencies

### External Dependencies

The lending system requires several external components:

<Card title="Oracle Network" icon="broadcast-tower">
  Real-time price feeds for collateral valuation. System halts if oracles fail or become stale beyond 15 minutes.
</Card>

<Card title="Trading Pools" icon="water">
  Liquidated collateral must have active trading pools for conversion to USDC. Thin liquidity increases liquidation slippage.
</Card>

<Card title="Blockchain Infrastructure" icon="cube">
  Transaction throughput for liquidations during market stress. Network congestion can delay critical liquidations.
</Card>

### Internal Dependencies

Core protocol components that must function correctly:

- **Interest Accrual**: Continuous calculation of borrowing costs
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time position assessment
- **Liquidation Queue**: Ordered processing of risky positions
- **Reserve Management**: Insurance fund allocation and deployment

## Risk Scenarios

### Market Risk

**Scenario**: Stock price drops 30% rapidly

**Impact**: 
- Collateral value decreases
- Health factors decline across positions
- Mass liquidations trigger

**Mitigation**:
- Conservative collateral factors provide buffer
- Partial liquidations reduce forced selling
- Insurance fund absorbs bad debt

### Liquidity Risk

**Scenario**: All suppliers want to withdraw simultaneously

**Impact**:
- Insufficient available liquidity
- Withdrawal restrictions activate
- Interest rates spike

**Mitigation**:
- Jump rate model discourages full utilization
- Reserve requirements ensure minimum liquidity
- Emergency liquidity provisions available

### Oracle Risk

**Scenario**: Price feed manipulation or failure

**Impact**:
- Incorrect collateral valuations
- Wrongful liquidations or missed liquidations
- Protocol insolvency risk

**Mitigation**:
- Multiple oracle sources with aggregation
- Staleness checks and circuit breakers
- Manual override capabilities for administrators

## Integration Considerations

### Instance Configuration

Institutions must determine appropriate parameters:

| Parameter | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Collateral Factor | 60% | 75% | 85% |
| Liquidation Threshold | 65% | 80% | 90% |
| Base Interest Rate | 1% | 3% | 5% |
| Insurance Target | 10% | 5% | 2% |

Conservative settings reduce risk but limit capital efficiency. Aggressive settings maximize returns but increase bad debt probability.

### Liquidity Management

Optimal liquidity deployment follows these principles:

**Initial Funding**: Start with smaller pools to test demand and refine parameters

**Scaling Strategy**: Increase liquidity as utilization stabilizes around target levels

**Reserve Planning**: Maintain 20% unutilized capacity for withdrawal demands

**Rebalancing**: Adjust interest parameters quarterly based on utilization patterns

### Compliance Integration

Lending operations must consider regulatory requirements:

<Note>
  Interest income may require tax reporting. Liquidation events could trigger capital gains calculations. Institutions should integrate appropriate reporting mechanisms.
</Note>

## Performance Metrics

### System Health Indicators

Monitor these metrics to assess lending market health:

| Metric | Healthy Range | Warning Signs |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Utilization Rate | 60-80% | Above 90% or below 20% |
| Average Health Factor | Above 1.5 | Below 1.2 |
| Bad Debt Ratio | Below 0.1% | Above 0.5% |
| Insurance Coverage | Above 5% TVL | Below 2% TVL |

### Return Analysis

Expected returns vary with risk parameters:

**Supply APY**: 3-8% depending on utilization
**Borrow APY**: 5-15% based on demand
**Net Interest Margin**: 2-5% after insurance allocation

Higher returns correlate with:
- Higher utilization rates
- Longer average loan duration
- Lower bad debt incidents
- Efficient liquidation execution

## Failure Modes

### Cascade Liquidation

Mass liquidations can create a death spiral:

1. Initial price drop triggers liquidations
2. Liquidation selling pressures prices further
3. More positions become unhealthy
4. Cycle continues until market stabilizes

**Prevention**: Partial liquidation limits, liquidation delays, circuit breakers

### Insurance Depletion

Sustained bad debt can exhaust reserves:

1. Multiple underwater positions accumulate
2. Insurance fund covers losses
3. Fund depletes below minimum threshold
4. New lending pauses until replenishment

**Recovery**: Emergency fund injection, increased insurance allocation, temporary spread increases

### Oracle Manipulation

Coordinated attack on price feeds:

1. Attacker influences oracle prices
2. Artificial liquidations or excessive borrowing
3. Protocol suffers losses when prices correct

**Defense**: Multi-oracle validation, TWAP usage, deviation limits, delayed execution
